#
# The job board lives on the garden's orphan `journal` branch. A `git push`
# of that branch to the shared origin is the cross-host serialization point:
# the first accepted fast-forward wins, which is the compare-and-swap that
# makes concurrent claims safe. Nothing here assumes a single worker.
#
# Every path and remote is environment-overridable so the test harness can
# point the same code at a throwaway journal. Defaults target the real garden.
#
# Source this; do not execute it.

# That wrapper pins the gh identity to the bot (kriscendobot) regardless of the
# mutable global active account in ~/.config/gh, with an explicit override path
# for the boatman's authorized-kriskowal ferries. See scripts/jobs/bin/gh and
# designs/fleet-gh-identity.md. Guarded so repeated sourcing in one process tree
# does not stack the entry.

# --- failure capture (the git-content-store pattern) -------------------------
#
# A self-healing wrapper should never inline a large failure log into a
# `claude -p` prompt: it bloats the responder's context and an identical failure
# never short-circuits. Instead, capture the log as a git blob and pass only its
# SHA; the responder pulls just the slices it needs with `git cat-file -p <sha> |
# grep/sed/awk/tail`. Identical inputs hash to identical SHAs, so recurring flakes
# are recognizable by their content address. See designs/self-healing-audit.md
# (Part B) and designs/driver.md § Prompt-on-failure capture pattern.
#
# Cross-host inspection (the local-clone-vs-cross-host nuance):
#   `git hash-object -w` writes the blob into the *local* object DB of <clone-dir>
#   only. Each v2 service hashes into its own $GARDEN_STATE/<svc>/journal clone
#   (the caller's $DIR), so the blob is reachable by any reader ON THIS HOST but
#   is NOT on origin and NOT visible to a responder on another host (the central
#   mentor may run elsewhere). A bare `hash-object` is therefore enough only when
#   the responder runs on the same host against the same clone.
#
#   For a failure that a DIFFERENT host must inspect, the SHA must be made
#   reachable on the shared remote. Two durable options, in order of preference:
#     1. Write the SHA into a *committed* board/inbox file (a job body, an
#        inbox-error report) and push it the normal CAS way. The commit references
#        the tree, not a loose blob, so `git push origin HEAD:journal2` carries the
#        blob with it. This is what the v1 report-error.sh does and is the default
#        for any capture that escalates off-host.
#     2. Anchor the loose blob under a ref and push that ref, when you want the
#        capture available before/without a committed escalation:
#          anchor_blob "$sha" "captures/$(basename ...)" "$dir"   # see below
#   A capture that only ever feeds a same-host responder needs neither.

# capture_blob <file> [<clone-dir>] -> prints the blob SHA on stdout.
#
# Hash <file> into <clone-dir>'s object store (default: the caller's per-service
# $DIR clone) and print the resulting blob SHA. The blob is written (-w) but
# unreferenced, so it lives only in that clone's local object DB until a commit
# or ref makes it reachable for a push — see the cross-host note above.

# responder narrows from there with a pipe (`| grep`, `| tail`, `| sed -n`); it
# never needs the whole blob in context. Pair the SHA with this note in any

# WITHOUT a committed escalation; the committed-file route (option 1 above) is the
