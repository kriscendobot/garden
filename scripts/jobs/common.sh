# The job board lives on the garden's orphan `journal` branch. A `git push`
# of that branch to the shared origin is the cross-host serialization point:
# the first accepted fast-forward wins, which is the compare-and-swap that
# makes concurrent claims safe. Nothing here assumes a single worker.
#
# Every path and remote is environment-overridable so the test harness can
# point the same code at a throwaway journal. Defaults target the real garden.

# "command not found" — every PR comment was dropped for ~16h with no error
# surfaced. require_tools makes any fleet hard dependency a LOUD, fail-fast
# precondition instead.

#
# On a missing tool it logs FATAL, best-effort surfaces a THROTTLED maintainer
# message (so a silent dependency gap reaches a human, not just a systemd log),
# and exits 1. The maintainer alert is best-effort and never masks the die: it
# is skipped entirely when GARDEN_NO_MAINTAINER_ALERT=1 (set by tests and by any
# context with no journal), and routed through GARDEN_ALERT_CMD when set (tests

# --- per-clone serialization (the shared-clone race fix) ---------------------
#
# Many producers share ONE journal clone: post-job, inbox-send, send-msg,
# set-schedule, set-schedule-once, set-gardeners, and journal-entry all default
# to $GARDEN_STATE/producer/journal. Without serialization their
# sync→write→commit→push critical sections interleave on a single working tree,
# index, and HEAD. The failure modes (all observed under an 8-way concurrent
# post): one process's sync_clone `reset --hard`/`clean` discards another's
# just-staged job before it pushes (then `git add`/`commit` aborts the script
# under `set -e`, BEFORE its retry loop — a silent directive loss); concurrent
# git invocations collide on `.git/index.lock`, `cannot lock ref 'HEAD'`, and
# `could not lock config file .git/config`; and a cold concurrent `git clone`
# into the same dir fails outright.
#
# We serialize the whole critical section with an flock held from sync_clone
# (or ensure_clone) through commit_and_push. The lock file is a SIBLING of the
# clone dir (outside the working tree) so `git clean`/`git add` never touch it,
# and closing the fd releases the lock even if the holder is killed — a crashed
# producer never wedges its peers. For per-service clones with no concurrent
# users the lock is uncontended: one cheap syscall. This is the smaller change
# than per-process clones (no new clone-per-invocation cost, no teardown) and
# removes the race at its source for every caller of the shared primitive.

# --- failure capture (the git-content-store pattern) -------------------------
#
# A self-healing wrapper should never inline a large failure log into a
# `claude -p` prompt: it bloats the responder's context and an identical failure
# never short-circuits. Instead, capture the log as a git blob and pass only its
# SHA; the responder pulls just the slices it needs with `git cat-file -p <sha> |
# grep/sed/awk/tail`. Identical inputs hash to identical SHAs, so recurring flakes
# are recognizable by their content address. See designs/self-healing-audit.md
# (Part B) and designs/driver.md § Prompt-on-failure capture pattern.
#
# Cross-host inspection (the local-clone-vs-cross-host nuance):
#   `git hash-object -w` writes the blob into the *local* object DB of <clone-dir>
#   only. Each v2 service hashes into its own $GARDEN_STATE/<svc>/journal clone
#   (the caller's $DIR), so the blob is reachable by any reader ON THIS HOST but
#   is NOT on origin and NOT visible to a responder on another host (the central
#   mentor may run elsewhere). A bare `hash-object` is therefore enough only when
#   the responder runs on the same host against the same clone.
#
#   For a failure that a DIFFERENT host must inspect, the SHA must be made
#   reachable on the shared remote. Two durable options, in order of preference:
#     1. Write the SHA into a *committed* board/inbox file (a job body, an
#        inbox-error report) and push it the normal CAS way. The commit references
#        the tree, not a loose blob, so `git push origin HEAD:journal2` carries the
#        blob with it. This is what the v1 report-error.sh does and is the default
#        for any capture that escalates off-host.
#     2. Anchor the loose blob under a ref and push that ref, when you want the
#        capture available before/without a committed escalation:
#          anchor_blob "$sha" "captures/$(basename ...)" "$dir"   # see below
#   A capture that only ever feeds a same-host responder needs neither.

# capture_blob <file> [<clone-dir>] -> prints the blob SHA on stdout.
#
# Hash <file> into <clone-dir>'s object store (default: the caller's per-service
# $DIR clone) and print the resulting blob SHA. The blob is written (-w) but
# unreferenced, so it lives only in that clone's local object DB until a commit
# or ref makes it reachable for a push — see the cross-host note above.
