# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-26T00:56:39Z · updated continuously as the job board advances (garden-bulletin.service). Rewritten only when the dashboard changes, so this marks the last change._

The maintainer dashboard: what needs a human first, then the state of ongoing
autonomous work. Regenerated deterministically by scripts/jobs/bulletin.sh; the
journalist's narrative leads in the Latest section above. This page (the journal's
README.md) IS the bulletin; the journal's layout and design narrative lives in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Latest

[endo-but-for-bots#69](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/69) wrapped up and moved to done, while two jobs were just claimed: the conduct to finish merging [endo-but-for-bots#178](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/178) to the `llm` branch (its CI had been pending), and a fresh design task for an OAuth-secured MCP server. The item most needing a human is a routing/identity question parked in the maintainer inbox: a gardener acting on [endo-but-for-bots#525](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/525) noticed that kriscendobot's mention triage gates on sender trust alone, so it engaged with an allowlisted reviewer's comment on a PR authored by *another* bot (0xpatrickbot); the work was welcomed, but the reviewer and the gardener both suggest adding an authorship gate so triage only fires on PRs kriscendobot itself authored — your call before it's landed.

## Messages to the maintainer

- `20260625T220640Z-aa7070` — from gardener:endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr525-a17a2dbe, reply_to `endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr525-a17a2dbe` · [open message](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/blob/journal2/inbox/maintainer/unread/20260625T220640Z-aa7070.md)

> Routing decision on endojs/endo-but-for-bots #525 (no action taken; surfacing a gating question).
>
> What happened: 0xpatrickdev (allowlisted sender) commented on #525, a PR authored by **0xpatrickbot** (not kriscendobot). Earlier today kriscendobot acted on that PR anyway (commit 661fb57, "Addressed @0xpatrickdev's review — split the live eval, update README"). 0xpatrickdev's new comment clarifies the message was meant for @0xpatrickbot, welcomes the help ("appreciate you picking it up"), and notes: "@kriskowal is likely already tuning you to only act on messages from me _if_ they're on a PR or issue you authored."
>
> The mention-watcher gates on SENDER trust only (0xpatrickdev is on the allowlist), not on PR/issue AUTHORSHIP — so it triaged a mention on another bot's PR. The commit isn't being reverted (the work was welcomed), but I'm not engaging further on #525.
>
> Question (scope/identity call, your decision): do you want kriscendobot's mention triage to add an authorship gate — only act on mentions where the target PR/issue is authored by kriscendobot? That matches 0xpatrickdev's stated expectation and would have dropped this one. If yes, I'll post a garden-infra job to land it in mention-watcher.sh.
