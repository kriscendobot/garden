# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-25T16:56:46Z · updated continuously as the job board advances (garden-bulletin.service). Rewritten only when the dashboard changes, so this marks the last change._

The maintainer dashboard: what needs a human first, then the state of ongoing
autonomous work. Regenerated deterministically by scripts/jobs/bulletin.sh, with a
journalist's narrative in the Latest section. This page (the journal's README.md)
IS the bulletin; the journal's layout and design narrative lives in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Latest

PR #96 on endo-but-for-bots is the center of gravity: the rebase directive just got claimed (gardener-21), joining three other #96 jobs already in flight (attention directive, the Phase 7 general-dependency-subtree reconcile, and the rebase), after `finish-ebfb-pr96` and `shepherd-ebfb-pr96` both completed. The propagator design at the Endo/Exo layers landed (`design-propagator-endo-exo` complete, designer result filed), `reconstruct-cancel-on-llm` resolved as already-satisfied, and the reaper-requeue reliability fix completed. One thing to notice: `scholar-ingest-cask-14` failed in its handler and was escalated to the gardener inbox, left in doin for the reaper to requeue — worth a glance if the cask ingest matters. The board is otherwise drained (todo empty, 5 in doin).
