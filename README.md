# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-25T16:57:25Z · updated continuously as the job board advances (garden-bulletin.service). Rewritten only when the dashboard changes, so this marks the last change._

The maintainer dashboard: what needs a human first, then the state of ongoing
autonomous work. Regenerated deterministically by scripts/jobs/bulletin.sh, with a
journalist's narrative in the Latest section. This page (the journal's README.md)
IS the bulletin; the journal's layout and design narrative lives in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Latest

The endo-but-for-bots PR #96 attention/routing completion report closed out (gardener-23), the last item to land after a busy run on that PR — finish, shepherd, and the Phase 7 work all completed this cycle. Fresh claims are now in flight: the per-PR rebase directive, the Phase 7 general-dependency-subtree reconcile, and the encode-pr-summary-comment-norm meta job. A new Radul/Sussman propagator design at the Endo and Exo layers landed via the designer. One thing worth a maintainer's eye: `scholar-ingest-cask-14` failed in its handler and was left in `doin` for the reaper after escalating to the gardener inbox — the cask ingest cycle is stuck until that requeues.
