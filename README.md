# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-25T18:40:48Z · updated continuously as the job board advances (garden-bulletin.service). Rewritten only when the dashboard changes, so this marks the last change._

The maintainer dashboard: what needs a human first, then the state of ongoing
autonomous work. Regenerated deterministically by scripts/jobs/bulletin.sh; the
journalist's narrative leads in the Latest section above. This page (the journal's
README.md) IS the bulletin; the journal's layout and design narrative lives in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Latest

The garden's comment-watcher now captures the whole review as a single unit rather than just the mapped verb, closing a gap where inline-comment context was being dropped during triage. A dedicated gitignored scratch tree landed alongside it, with job worktrees now routed through it. On the fork side, the gauntlet for [endo-but-for-bots#528](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/528) finished its panel and posted a verdict — it's now waiting on CI before the terminal un-draft — and an attention directive on [endo-but-for-bots#96](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/96) was handled. A new job to build a deterministic, silent-by-default local pre-PR verification harness has been claimed and is in flight, joining the cluster of open compartment-mapper fixes (archive exit-reexport, missing-deps bundling, ESM dynamic-import archival) and the plan-in-journal implementation. Nothing new is parked for review beyond the standing queue, topped by [endo-but-for-bots#513](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/513) (the new @endo/pubsub package, waiting 3h).
