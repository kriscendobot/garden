## Latest

Three maintainer decisions now sit unanswered in the inbox and each needs your steer. A comment on [endo-but-for-bots#405](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/405) was misclassified as a "rebase" when it is actually a feature directive — reshape the inventory taxonomy (Directories/Agents/Personas/Values/Capabilities) and fully hide empty groups across space-chat, chat, cli, and daemon; the v2 fleet has no autonomous path for implementing a feature directive, so this needs a liaison-driven builder/fixer dispatch (a separate infra job was posted for the classifier bug). The merged [endo-but-for-bots#474](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/474) spawned a "harden exported function literals" follow-up that is gated on two answers from you — breadth (just the two evasive-transform exports, or repo-wide via the `@endo/harden-exports` rule) and base branch (`llm` vs `master`, which changes the diff shape since the literals are still function declarations on `llm`). And the formula-inspector retention-paths table is blocked on #284, which has been stalled since 2026-05-21 with 4 failing CI checks after your rebase-and-re-gamut request went unactioned; a gardener offered to take that rebase as its own job on your word.

Concluded without changes: the [endo-but-for-bots#442](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/442) revisit confirmed the test-powers duplication is intrinsic (reusing `@endo/daemon`'s powers would invert the extraction and create a workspace cycle), and an endo-master lint sweep came back clean — only 5 non-failing jsdoc warnings, parked as a low-priority plan. Scholar landed two library additions on journal2: MetaMask's ocap-kernel host-app guide (the sixth ocap-kernel ingest) and a six-topic distributed-ocap concept cluster (three-party-handoff, sturdyref, distributed-confinement, eventual-send, grant-matcher), with the grant-matcher source deferred because erights.org was unreachable. Separately, the beta3 ymax0/XS investigation concluded the nested-record vat abort is an XS native-stack-depth property rather than an Endo regression, leaving the v320 swing-store export and any contract-side depth-bounding fix as your calls — both in agoric-sdk territory the garden won't touch autonomously.

## Messages to the maintainer

- `20260627T073148Z-d2f9fb` — from gardener:formula-inspector-retention-paths-table, reply_to `formula-inspector-retention-paths-table` · [open message](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/blob/journal2/inbox/maintainer/unread/20260627T073148Z-d2f9fb.md)

> Job `formula-inspector-retention-paths-table` is BLOCKED on its data source and I'm reporting the gap (not reimplementing the graph walk, per the plan's own instruction).
>
> Why blocked:
> - The table must source its data from #284 (`listRetentionPaths` host API). #284 is still OPEN and NOT on base `llm`.
> - #284 is stalled since 2026-05-21: you asked "Please rebase and run the gamut again" — that rebase/re-gamut never happened, and it currently has 4 failing CI checks (22/26 green). Not mergeable as-is.
> - Building the table now would require either binding to a non-existent host method (CI can't pass on `llm`) or duplicating the graph walk in the UI — which the plan explicitly forbids.
>
> Good news (the follow-on is ready the moment #284 lands):
> - #284 exposes the right shape over the captp `HostInterface`: `listRetentionPaths(locator) -> Promise<RetentionPath[]>` and `followRetentionPaths(locator) -> AsyncIterator<RetentionPathDelta>`. Each `RetentionPath` is segments with `{ groupMembers, referencedBy, labels }` (pet edges => `pet:<name>`, root segment `type:"root"`) — exactly a table's rows. The chat UI can reach it because it's on the host captp interface, not CLI-only.
> - The inspector back-face to extend is `packages/spaces-util/src/formula-view.js` (#440, merged into `llm` 2026-06-27).
>
> Recommended unblock: land #284 first (the rebase + gamut you already requested), then re-promote this plan from `jobs/plan/` to `todo/`. I can take the #284 rebase-and-gamut as a separate job if you want — say the word and I'll post it.

> Library: ingested MetaMask/ocap-kernel `docs/kernel-guide.md` (the 689-line host-app developer
> guide) — the **sixth ocap-kernel ingest** and the most direct source yet for the kernel/vat model.
> 11 sections + a synthesizing [[ocap-kernel]] concept, cross-linked to the garden's ocap corpus.
>
> Synthesis — how MetaMask's kernel (an external SwingSet-lineage sibling, distinct from @endo)
> relates to our material:
> - Shared substrate: `E()` is imported straight from `@endo/eventual-send`; exos wrap `@endo/exo`
>   `makeExo`.
> - Signature divergences (flagged honestly per section): kref/vref/rref/eref four-scope reference
>   name-space vs Endo's single formula identifier; first-class `kernel.revoke(kref)` vs Endo's
>   compositional caretaker/membrane revocation; kernel services registered-by-name + access-checked
>   at subcluster launch vs Endo powers through the formula graph; `Far()` forbidden in favor of
>   `makeDefaultExo`.
> - Six-sections ocap cross-links wired: distributed confinement (vat endowment allowlists),
>   three-party hand-off (bootstrap-as-introducer; bidirectional links into granovetter-operator +
>   four-ways-to-acquire-references), eventual send, sturdyrefs (baggage-stored cross-vat refs).
>
> Deferred follow-on plans parked: `scholar-ingest-ocap-kernel-usage` (docs/usage.md) and
> `scholar-ingest-ocap-kernel-packages` (per-package READMEs + kernel-internals comment fragments).

> Scholar ingest — six ocap library sections (job ingest-ocap-library-sections, gardener 93):
>
> Synthesis: the six requested topics already had their authoritative SOURCES ingested in the library; the gap was the concept-layer synthesis tying them together. Landed a distributed-ocap concept cluster on journal2 (commit dc5d328e):
>
> - three-party-handoff — OCapN CapTP § Third Party Handoffs (Gifter/Receiver/Exporter, signed gift/handoff certificates); the Granovetter operator across sessions.
> - sturdyref — OCapN Locators § Sturdyref (Peer Locator + swiss-num) + Concurrency Among Strangers §9.2; the durable/offline reference, Initial-Conditions made persistent.
> - distributed-confinement — Paradigm Regained §5 (Cassie/Max factory, data diode, non-discretionary) + the Confinement Myth; confinement across vats.
> - eventual-send — @endo/eventual-send (E()/HandledPromise) + CAS vat/event-loop; umbrella over promise-pipelining and handler-protocol.
> - grant-matcher-puzzle ("grant matching") — Mark Miller's erights.org equality puzzle. This is the one with NO in-corpus source: erights.org/caplet.com were unreachable (ECONNREFUSED). Page is flagged draft/external-lineage; follow-on scholar-ingest-grant-matcher-puzzle parked (deferred) to ingest the source when erights.org is reachable.
>
> Cross-linked the three pre-existing concepts (granovetter-operator, pass-invariant-handle-equality, promise-pipelining) bidirectionally; the six interlock exactly as predicted (handoff↔grant-matching↔sturdyref↔eventual-send↔confinement; pass-invariant equality underlies all). Also parked scholar-ingest-passable-equality (low) to broaden equality beyond the Handle-side instance.

> Topic whose source I could not locate: grant matching (erights.org down) — concept written from a web-search summary, honestly flagged, source-ingest deferred.

> Lint classification — endo master (endo-but-for-bots master @364d69ba1).
>
> FINDING: master lint is CLEAN. CI's `yarn lint` gate (prettier + root eslint + shellcheck) is fully green; per-package eslint across 49 packages and spot-checked tsc are clean too. There are NO lint ERROR classes to fix.
>
> The only findings are 5 jsdoc WARNINGS (do not fail CI), in 2 rule-classes:
>   - jsdoc/require-param ×4 (packages/daemon) — autofixable
>   - jsdoc/check-tag-names ×1 (compartment-mapper, @remarks tag) — needs judgment
>
> Posted ONE deferred/low plan covering both: `fix-lint-jsdoc-warnings-endo-master` (consolidated rather than two near-empty per-rule plans, since both are tiny jsdoc warnings). Promote it if you want the warnings cleared.
>
> Note: bot master is 64 commits AHEAD of upstream endo (legitimately merged bot-fork PRs) and 8 behind; I did NOT force-sync to upstream — the ahead commits are real work, not drift.

- `20260627T123905Z-ee2b02` — from gardener:endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr442-revisit-reusable-test-powers, reply_to `endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr442-revisit-reusable-test-powers` · [open message](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/blob/journal2/inbox/maintainer/unread/20260627T123905Z-ee2b02.md)

> Revisit of PR #442 deferred plan (reusable file/crypto powers for @endo/daemon-cas tests) — concluded: intrinsic duplication, no change.
>
> Survey result:
> - The only API-exact match for the four-method ContentStoreFilePowers / ContentStoreCryptoPowers is @endo/daemon's makeFilePowers({fs,path}) + makeCryptoPowers(crypto) in daemon-node-powers.js (a superset of both contracts). BUT @endo/daemon has @endo/daemon-cas as a runtime dependency (the point of the #442 extraction), so a daemon-cas test depending on @endo/daemon — even devDep — inverts the extraction and creates a workspace cycle. Architecturally disallowed.
> - @endo/platform (a real daemon-cas dep) exposes makeLocalBlob/makeLocalTree (a higher-level blob/tree CAS abstraction), not the four-method powers shape, and no array->async-iterable helper. Not narrowable without a wrapper as large as the inline shim.
> - @endo/stream exports only queue/stream/pipe primitives — no array->async-iterable helper (trigger #1 does not hold).
> - content-store.test.js is the ONLY workspace file constructing this powers shim (trigger #2 does not hold). asAsyncIterable-style inline generators in other tests (chat, exo-stream, ocapn-noise) are each local 4-6 line generators, no shared helper.
>
> Both re-arm triggers stay armed; the plan re-fires if @endo/stream gains a real array->async-iterable helper, or a second test reaches for the same real-fs/crypto powers shim. Optional low-risk improvement if you want it folded into #442: a one-line comment by the inline shim noting the identical @endo/daemon powers are intentionally not reused because daemon depends on daemon-cas. I left the PR branch untouched since it is under active review.

> # Scope decision needed: "harden exported function literals" follow-up (endo-but-for-bots)
>
> Origin: erights bullet 4 on endojs/endo-but-for-bots#474 — "agreed, not in this
> PR. Please start a separate PR with that change... Attn @kriskowal". The job is
> gated on you scoping its breadth before any cross-repo PR opens.
>
> What I verified (read-only) today:
>
> - **#474 is MERGED** (into `master`, 2026-06-26): "retire function-keyword in
>   favor of arrow/method syntax per erights review". No open PR on endo-but-for-bots
>   or endo covers the harden follow-up.
> - **The literal form differs by branch** — this matters for how the change is
>   written and which base to target:
>   - Default/working branch `llm`: `evadeCensorSync`/`evadeCensor` are still
>     un-hardened **function declarations** (index.js:65 / :129).
>   - `master` (post-#474): the arrow-const form erights reviewed (his ref was
>     index.js:91).
> - A real `@endo/harden-exports` eslint rule exists in the repo (#474 touched it),
>   so a repo-wide pass would lean on / interact with it.
> - Note: the parked job spec described the evasive-transform exports as
>   "un-hardened arrow consts" — that's only true on `master`; on the `llm` default
>   they're function declarations. So the base branch choice changes the diff shape.
>
> Decision I need from you (two axes):
>
> 1. **Breadth** — (a) **narrow**: harden only the two evasive-transform exports
>    (`evadeCensorSync`, `evadeCensor`); or (b) **repo-wide**: harden every exported
>    function literal, driven by/aligned with the `@endo/harden-exports` rule
>    (designer-first; larger blast radius). erights authorized (a) and framed (b) as
>    the better trailing form.
> 2. **Base branch** — target `llm` (default) or `master`?
>
> On your answer I'll dispatch a builder (narrow) or designer→builder (repo-wide) to
> open a DRAFT PR with that scope and run the gamut. Authorization to open the
> cross-repo PR is already carried by erights's directive; only breadth + base are
> owed.

> Report investigate-beta3-ymax0-xs-repro-and-fix raised two decisions that are yours, both touching ymax0/agoric-sdk territory (out of bounds for autonomous garden action):
>
> 1. A **v320 swing-store export** is the missing artifact gating the real-data trace and the targeted fix. Sourcing that production export is your call — the garden can't autonomously obtain it, and the downstream work lands in agoric-sdk/contract territory, which is off-limits to us.
>
> 2. The minimal XS repro (nested-record passStyleOf/checkMatches overflow → uncatchable vat abort at ~15/~116 levels) could seed an **upstream-Endo note "if desired"** — but the investigation concluded this is an XS native-stack-depth property, **not an Endo regression** (frames/level unchanged), so the real fix is **contract-side depth-bounding**, not Endo. Whether to file the Endo note at all, and the contract-side fix itself, are both yours to direct.
>
> Tell me if you want either turned into a job (e.g. a write-up I can draft on a bot repo), and please advise on obtaining the v320 export.

> Misrouted comment-watcher classification + a real maintainer directive on endojs/endo-but-for-bots PR #405.
>
> WHAT HAPPENED
> - Job 'endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr405-rebase' was created from kriskowal's comment on PR #405 and classified as "rebase".
> - That classification is wrong. The comment is a feature-refinement directive, not a rebase. PR #405 is already MERGEABLE, so there is no rebase to perform. I did not run a no-op rebase.
>
> THE ACTUAL DIRECTIVE (kriskowal, https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/405#issuecomment-4819835663):
> - Hide groups that are empty (e.g. Workers when there are no workers).
> - Replace the current taxonomy (Handles / Hubs / Workers / Everything Else) with:
>   - "Directories": directories, readable trees, mounts, scratch mounts
>   - "Agents": guests
>   - "Personas": hosts
>   - "Values": marshal
>   - "Capabilities": all others
> - This is a cross-package change: packages/space-chat (inventory grouping), packages/chat (CSS + tests), packages/cli (endo list --grouped buckets + tests), packages/daemon (type annotation, if the new buckets need new types). The PR already implements the 4-group version and partial empty-group hiding via CSS; the ask reshapes the buckets and asks for full empty-group hiding.
>
> RECOMMENDATION
> Route this as a fixer/builder directive on PR #405 through the gamut (researcher -> builder/fixer -> judge panel). The v2 fleet has no autonomous "implement a maintainer feature directive" path (garden-pr.sh is review/panel + fixer-loop only), so this needs a liaison-driven dispatch. endo-but-for-bots carries standing comment authorization, so the eventual fixer should also post a top-level summary comment.
>
> I am separately posting a garden-infra fix job for the classifier bug that misrouted this to "rebase".
