# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-07-14T21:09:37Z_

## Latest

Milestone M3 is now entirely merge-bottlenecked, not work-bottlenecked: its two headline exit-criterion PRs — [endo-but-for-bots#694](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/694) (Docker self-host + authenticated remote gateway, which supersedes the older master-based [#608](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/608)) and [#661](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/661) (confined outbound HTTP) — are built, un-drafted, and CI-green but stranded as poisoned, go-ahead-gated gauntlet jobs, whose only red is the repo-wide lint projectService ceiling that [#594](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/594) would clear. Merging #594 also auto-resumes the parked lint-ceiling shepherd cohort. On the fork side, [kriscendobot/agoric-sdk#9](https://github.com/kriscendobot/agoric-sdk/pull/9) (ymax→critical) was rebased onto master, is fully green and un-drafted, and mhofman's two open review threads are now answered — so it is blocked solely on a SwingSet-team approval that the fleet cannot supply. The scheduled-execution leg pivoted: design [#682](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/682) (`@endo/reminder` unconfined plugin) supersedes the endoclaw-timer stack [#609](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/609)/[#617](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/617)/[#619](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/619) and awaits an accept/close call.

Two SES-shim decisions surfaced as forks in the road: [#259](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/259) (hardened text codecs) was rebased mergeable and is one merge from closing M2, while the URL shim now has competing implementations — the design-faithful `%URL%`/`%SharedURL%` split in new draft [#719](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/719) versus the earlier universal [#263](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/263) — needing a pick before either lands. The SturdyRef agent-surface design [#695](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/695) still awaits its go/no-go to release builder cuts A–F, though its bridge stack ([#521](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/521)→[#541](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/541)→…→[#704](https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/704)) sits green. Off the PR track, finbot completed its OODA loop end to end — OBSERVE→ORIENT→DECIDE→AUDIT→ACT now all run by inference in dry-run atop new GARCH/GJR-GARCH/adaptive-vol forecasting, ~500 tests green with the wallet-untouched safety gate holding — and is deferred only at cap-attenuation Phase 2, which needs explicit `live_authorized` maintainer approval.

Two operational flags warrant a look: the triager crash-loop fix is landed on `main2` but the deployed root is ~56 commits behind, so a drained `deploy-garden.sh` is still needed to actually stop the flapping `garden-triager@*` units; and a run of shepherd/gauntlet/deadmail jobs are deterministically overrunning the 2400s handler budget and getting poisoned — they need splitting into claim-sized stages rather than requeueing.

> gardener job 'endojs-endo-but-for-bots-pr688-shepherd' DETERMINISTICALLY overran its handler budget (rc=124 at the wall, elapsed=2400s ≈ handler-budget=2400s).

The PR is green on CI but still DRAFT; drive it to review-passed and un-drafted so it joins the merge-ready stack (#705/#706/#708) alongside it.

> POISON job PARKED in jobs/plan/ (held, gate=go-ahead) after 1 DEADLINE-OVERRUN cycles on endolin-garden2-5bcdff64.
> Its handler hit its OWN wall-clock budget every cycle (rc=124, elapsed≈GARDEN_HANDLER_TIMEOUT=2400s):
> this job EXCEEDS THE HANDLER BUDGET and would be killed identically on every requeue,
> so the reaper surfaced it after 1 overrun cycles (not the full 5-cycle poison threshold).
> The work is preserved at jobs/plan/kriscendobot-agoric-sdk-pr15-shepherd; it stays HELD until a human promotes it
> (promote-plan.sh kriscendobot-agoric-sdk-pr15-shepherd) or removes it. Triage: split the job, raise GARDEN_HANDLER_TIMEOUT
> for this work, or fix what makes it run long.
