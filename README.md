# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-25T15:21:06Z · updated continuously as the job board advances (garden-bulletin.service). Rewritten only when the dashboard changes, so this marks the last change._

The maintainer dashboard: what needs a human first, then the state of ongoing
autonomous work. Regenerated deterministically by scripts/jobs/bulletin.sh, with a
journalist's narrative in the Latest section. This page (the journal's README.md)
IS the bulletin; the journal's layout and design narrative lives in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Messages to the maintainer

- `20260625T150946Z-9ec67f` — from gardener:scholar-continue-change-propagation, reply_to `scholar-continue-change-propagation` · [open message](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/blob/journal2/inbox/maintainer/unread/20260625T150946Z-9ec67f.md)

> Change-propagation library — synthesis update (scholar, maintainer-endorsed pursuit).
>
> Curated the two missing pubsub sources into the library as proper, idempotency-anchored
> source pages (both still on unmerged PR branches, flagged accordingly):
>
> - @endo/pubsub README (#513, feat/endo-pubsub) — 4 sections.
> - notifier-pubsub-migration design (#507, revision 5) — 8 sections, including the
>   asymmetric-passability framing, the full @endo/exo-pubsub adapter set, and the FRB
>   collection-change-propagation future direction.
>
> Two honesty corrections the new sources forced:
> 1. makeCancelKit is NOT an @endo/pubsub export — the bundled cancel kit + barrel index
>    were dropped per review (commit d15e34cb); its home is @endo/cancel, a prerequisite
>    package not yet on llm. The prior endo-pubsub concept page asserted it as a package
>    export; corrected.
> 2. #513 and #507 have diverged on factory names (makeChangeTopic/makeLatestTopic +
>    {publisher, subscribe} in the implementation vs makeChangesPubSub/makeLatestPubSub +
>    {sink, makeSpring, finish, fail} in the design). Recorded both from source and
>    flagged for reconciliation.
>
> Folded the landed research-frb-endo-exo-collections findings into sliding-window-topic
> (the ordered-set observable contract, SortedSet splay vs SortedArraySet, makeViewObserver's
> five-branch splicer, the proposed makeWindowTopic with query()+subscribe()) — flagged as
> draft, not shipped. Preserved the propagator honesty flag intact (FRB two-way bindings the
> one in-corpus instance; Sussman/Radul lattice-merge model cited as external lineage only).
> gtor is already fully ingested (9 sections), so direction 3 needed no new work.
>
> Posted follow-on job scholar-reingest-pubsub-on-stabilize to refresh both sources and
> reconcile the factory names when #513/#507/@endo/cancel stabilize. All on origin/journal2.

## Latest

gardener-47 claimed `fix-reaper-requeue-reliability` — the standing reliability bug where the reaper never wins the requeue race, so stranded claims sit forever. That brings the doin lane to four live jobs, all the rest scholar ingests (cask cycles 13/14) and the endo-but-for-bots #96 finish. The board has otherwise drained quiet: this cycle's scholar change-propagation synthesis, the #513 rebase, and the git-fetch-timeout hardening all completed, and the pubsub re-ingest closed as a no-op after the scholar found #513/#507 unmoved. todo is empty. Worth a maintainer's eye: the scholar's inbox note flags two unreconciled factory-name divergences between #513's implementation and #507's design, parked behind a follow-on job until both stabilize.
