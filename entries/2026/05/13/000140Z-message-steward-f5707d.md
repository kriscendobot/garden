# Mirrored: process/README.md

Verbatim. The prior garden's index of `process/` documents, naming
each file with its type, the role that authored it, and the snapshot
date. Useful for cross-referencing: the snapshot dates here are the
authoritative answer to "how old is the data in document X".

# Process documents

Process documents are artifact-of-the-work, not artifact-of-the-
product: audit reports, gap reports, snapshots, open-question
logs, work-handoff lists.
They describe how the work was done; they are for the
conversation between the user and the agents.

For the rules on what counts as a process document, where to put
new ones, and the isolation-commit discipline, see
[`../skills/process-documents.md`](../skills/process-documents.md).

## Conventions

- Process commits are isolated (only `process/` changes per commit,
  plus possibly this index). They drop cleanly when a maintainer
  ports work upstream.
- Commit messages start with `process:` or `process(<role>):`.
- Each new file should be added to the table above in the same
  process commit that introduces it.
- A snapshot that has been superseded gets a one-line header
  (`> Superseded by <newer file> on <date>.`) rather than being
  deleted; the audit trail is useful when the same question
  recurs.
