# Mirrored: process/TRIAGE.md

Verbatim. A 2026-04-26 triager snapshot from twelve audit subagents
covering 338 open issues and 251 open/draft PRs against local mirrors
at `issues/` and `changes/`. Findings classify each as LIKELY-LANDED,
PARTIAL, LANDED-ELSEWHERE, LIKELY-OBSOLETE, or STALE-DRAFT, with
a separate "close these" list of issues whose implementation has
merged.

The lists are actionable in the prior garden (close-or-comment
sweeps); in this generation of the garden the dispatching role
needed for that work (`triager` follow-up) is not active, so the
content sits as a referenceable index until the role lands.

# Triage Report — Open Issues and PRs Whose Work Has Already Landed

Twelve subagents audited the 338 open issues and 251 open/draft PRs against
the local mirrors at `issues/` and `changes/`.
This file consolidates their findings.

Conventions:

- **LIKELY-LANDED** — a merged PR plainly addresses the request.
- **PARTIAL** — a merged PR addresses some of the request; remaining work noted.
- **LANDED-ELSEWHERE** — an open or draft PR's change has been merged via a
  different PR.
- **LIKELY-OBSOLETE** — the PR cannot land as-is (DO NOT MERGE in title, dead
  base branch, references nonexistent package, or refactor superseded the
  approach).
- **STALE-DRAFT** — open ≥18 months with no recent activity and no clear
  successor.

  against bundled-dep / URL-dep name spoofing (test still in draft #1967).
- [#661](./issues/661.md) — React Native Compat tracking epic — Hermes shim
  (#2334), `hostEvaluators` (#2723), and tighter v8 sniff (#2952 draft) cover
  the major boxes; tracker remains since some sub-items are open.

  cross-links via #2442 (2024-12); missing: explicit `getCopySetKeys()` doc.

  automation via #3066 (2026-01); missing: Token-Permissions / least-privilege

### Unclear (epics, philosophical, "we should think about X")

A separate cluster of ~30 issues are scoped as epics, design discussions, or
"we should think about X someday" items that don't map onto a single PR.
Examples: #22 (earliest platforms), #26 (test262 epic), #105 (TC39 override
mistake), #289, #310, #486, #870, #879 (Pet Daemon epic), #1003, #1191
(TypeScript environment), #2117, #2244, #2752, #2823, #2859, #3019, #3024,
#3140.
These should be reviewed by a maintainer rather than auto-closed.

## Open or draft PRs whose change has merged elsewhere

### Landed elsewhere — close as superseded

- [#1506](./changes/1506.md) → superseded by **#1507** (2023-07): own
  description says "Abandoned in favor of #1507".
- [#1779](./changes/1779.md) → superseded by **#2615** (2024-10): repo-wide
  jsdoc/recommended-typescript-flavor enabled.
- [#2204](./changes/2204.md) → superseded by **#2720** (2025-02): `@endo/
  benchmark` package using the same `eshost`+`esvu` runner.
- [#2989](./changes/2989.md) → superseded by **#3008** (2026-02): `@endo/
  harden` introduced with `hardened`/`shallow`/`noop-harden` modes.
- [#3061](./changes/3061.md) → superseded by **#3172** (2026-04): `CopyArray<T>`
  is now `readonly T[]`.
- [#3063](./changes/3063.md) → made obsolete by **#3172** (was the analysis
  sub-PR of #3061).
- 12 Dependabot bump PRs from 2024-09 → all superseded by **#2866** group bump
  (2025-08), or by removal of the dependency (Rollup is no longer a direct dep
  of `bundle-source` or `evasive-transform`):
  #2523, #2526, #2530, #2535, #2537, #2538, #2545, #2548, #2555, #2571,
  #2572, #2701.

### Likely-obsolete — close without porting

- ~10 explicit "DO NOT MERGE" / diagnostic / dead-base-branch drafts: #1014,
  #1075, #1494, #1505, #1630, #1632, #2031, #2395.
- ~43 Dependabot per-package c8/eslint bumps now centralized via the **catalog
  refactor (#2966)**: every `chore: bump c8 in /packages/*` and `chore: bump
  eslint in /packages/*` PR opened before the catalog landed.
- ~10 ContribAI scaffolding submissions for nonexistent packages: #3139,
  #3142, #3143, #3144, #3145, #3146, #3148, #3166, #3167, #3168, #3169, #3170.
  These reference `packages/regexp-escape`, `packages/smallcaps`, `packages/
  fs`, `packages/agent`, etc. that do not exist in the tree; they were
  drive-by submissions in October 2026.

### Stale drafts (open ≥18 months, no successor)

- ~38 Dependabot per-package c8/eslint/ava bumps from 2024-10 plus older
  security bumps (#1361, #1389, #1483, #2479–#2494).
- ~25 feature/bug drafts last touched in 2022–2024: #1149, #1168, #1256,
  #1408, #1410, #1412, #1416, #1572, #1573, #1608, #1620, #1692, #1709,
  #1722, #1804, #1813, #1877, #1967, #2044, #2051, #2057, #2119, #2401,
  #727, #892.
- 12 newer drafts that have been quiet but may still have intent: #2871,
  #2875, #2924, #2926, #2931, #2961, #2997, #3000, #3006, #3033, #3049,
  #3068, #3075, #3090, #3099, #3118, #3121, #3124, #3134, #3154, #3164,
  #3175, #3187, #3197, #3205, #3206 (boneskull `parser-pipeline` stack and
  `llm`-branch Cursor-agent drafts).

## Suggested actions

The highest-leverage cleanup, in order:

1. **Close the 20 likely-landed issues** — quick maintainer pass with the PR
   citation. Each costs roughly one comment and one click.
2. **Close the 18 PRs in "Landed elsewhere" with a one-line "superseded by
   #N" comment** — they're all clear-cut.
3. **Close the ~50 Dependabot bumps superseded by the catalog refactor** —
   ideally as a single batch comment per bot run, with a link to #2966.
4. **Triage the ContribAI scaffolding submissions** — uniformly close as
   "unrelated to current package layout" unless a maintainer sees value.
5. **Revisit the partially-landed issues** for whether the residual scope is
   worth a separate ticket vs. closing the existing one once the merged
   portion is documented.

## Auxiliary inputs

- `/tmp/iss-batch-{1..9}.txt` — input lists for the issue audits.
