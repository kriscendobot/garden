# Mirrored: process/PR-REBASE-AUDIT.md

Verbatim. A 2026-04-30 shepherd snapshot of open PRs that needed
a rebase, with per-PR diagnosis (what conflicts, against which base,
which agent should do the rebase). Static snapshot; significantly
out of date by the prior steward's hand-off (many of the audited
PRs have since rebased or merged).

# PR Rebase Hygiene Audit -- endojs/endo-but-for-bots

Audited 60 open PRs against their respective base branches, snapshot at 2026-05-01T01:42:55Z.

All PR base branches resolve on the `bots` remote -- no PRs are orphaned by a deleted base.

## Green (16) -- rebased and linear

`behind == 0` and no merge commits in `base..head`. Already perfectly stacked.

## Needs rebase (36) -- clean fast-forward, no conflicts

`behind > 0`, `merge-tree` clean. A `git rebase bots/<base>` would land cleanly with no human input.

## Needs rebase with conflicts (6)

`behind > 0` and `git merge-tree` reports conflicts. Author intervention required.

- #7 | llm <- dependabot/npm_and_yarn/eslint-config-prettier-10.1.8 | 717 behind, ahead=1 | chore: bump eslint-config-prettier from 9.1.0 to 10.1.8
  - Conflicts in (sample): package.json, yarn.lock
- #9 | llm <- dependabot/npm_and_yarn/types/node-25.2.3 | 717 behind, ahead=1 | chore: bump @types/node from 20.17.24 to 25.2.3
  - Conflicts in (sample): package.json, yarn.lock
- #10 | llm <- dependabot/npm_and_yarn/eslint-plugin-jsdoc-62.5.5 | 717 behind, ahead=1 | chore: bump eslint-plugin-jsdoc from 50.6.1 to 62.5.5
  - Conflicts in (sample): yarn.lock
- #5 | llm <- dependabot/github_actions/changesets/action-1.7.0 | 682 behind, ahead=1 | chore: bump changesets/action from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0
  - Conflicts in (sample): .github/workflows/release.yml
- #27 | master <- design/base64-native-fallthrough | 27 behind, ahead=5 | feat(base64): dispatch to native Uint8Array base64 intrinsics
  - Conflicts in (sample): .changeset/base64-native-fallthrough.md, packages/base64/src/decode.js, packages/base64/src/encode.js, packages/base64/test/forced-polyfill.test.js
- #55 | master <- kriskowal-base64 | 8 behind, ahead=4 | feat(base64): hardened module + native ponyfill
  - Conflicts in (sample): packages/base64/src/decode.js

## Has merge commits (2)

`base..head` log contains at least one merge commit. The repo prefers linear-history rebase merges, so these usually indicate the author merged base into branch instead of rebasing -- but see notes for exceptions (long-lived feature branches with intentional merges).

- #8 | llm <- dependabot/npm_and_yarn/noble/hashes-2.0.1 | 1 merge commit(s), 682 behind, ahead=4 | chore: bump @noble/hashes from 1.8.0 to 2.0.1
  - Dependabot PR. Head branch contains a 1-commit dependency bump plus 3 leftover Claude-workflow commits (`Add Claude Code GitHub Workflow`, `"Claude Code Review workflow"`, `"Claude PR Assistant workflow"`). Recommend re-running Dependabot or rebuilding the branch from `bots/llm` with only the version bump.
- #17 | llm <- endor | 98 merge commit(s), 0 behind, ahead=662 | Rust endor supervisor: bus daemon, XS worker, CAS, debugger, npm registry
  - Note: `endor` is a long-lived feature branch that legitimately carries merge commits from upstream history (98 merges including `Merge remote-tracking branch 'actual/llm' into endor`). Not author misuse; treat as a stacked feature-branch PR rather than a rebasable PR.

## Stacked PRs (base is the head of another open PR)

None of these block the audit but they form chains where the parent PR's state matters.

- #21 (endor) -- depends on PR(s): #17
- #22 (endor) -- depends on PR(s): #17
- #56 (design/endo-xorshift) -- depends on PR(s): #52
- #58 (design/error-tracing-across-workers) -- depends on PR(s): #50

## Base branch not on bots (0)

Every open PR's `baseRefName` resolves to a branch on the `bots` remote. None to flag.

## Summary

| Category | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Green | 16 |
| Needs rebase (clean) | 36 |
| Needs rebase (conflicts) | 6 |
| Has merge commits | 2 |
| Base missing | 0 |

## Key recommendations

Of the 36 clean-rebase PRs, the seven oldest (#1-#5, #7, #9, #10) sit ~717 commits behind `bots/llm` -- they should either be rebased now or closed if abandoned, since the deeper they fall the higher the future conflict risk; #1-#4 and #7 still rebase cleanly, but #5, #9, and #10 already conflict. The 51-behind cluster (#43-#48) appears to share an `llm` base bump from the recent `Merge llm branches` commit and should rebase mechanically as a batch.

PR #8 (Dependabot noble/hashes bump) is contaminated with three stale Claude-workflow commits and should be regenerated rather than rebased; PR #17 (`endor` -> `llm`) is a long-lived feature branch whose merge commits are intentional and is *not* a rebase candidate. The four stacked PRs (#21, #22, #56, #58) should be reviewed once their parents land.
