# Mirrored: process/AGENT-READY-ISSUES.md

Verbatim. A 2026-04-28 triager snapshot of upstream `endojs/endo`
issues that are well-described enough for an agent to implement with
little intervention. Each row carries an implementation plan naming
the package(s), the file(s), the change, and how to verify done.

Several issues in the queue were marked "in flight as bots PR #N" at
the time of writing; those notes may be stale. Verify state before
acting.

# Agent-Ready Issues

Open Endo issues that are sufficiently well-described that an agent can
implement them with little intervention.
For each: a 1–3 sentence implementation plan naming the package(s), the
file(s), the specific change, and how to verify done.

The bar:

- single package, single function/file/option, or a clearly enumerated
  checklist;
- concrete acceptance criteria;
- no unresolved design question;
- no upstream dependency;
- a small PR (single-digit files).

## Ready (11)

- **[#3202](./issues/3202.md)** — `setFloat16` / `setFloat32` write zero bytes
  for NaN.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/ses/src/tame-nan-sidechannel.js`, replace the
    `Number(canonicalNaN)` coercion in the `setFloat16`/`setFloat32` wrappers
    with size-correct constants (`0x7e00` via `setUint16`, `0x7fc00000` via
    `setUint32`).
    Extend `packages/ses/test/tame-nan-sidechannel.test.js` to round-trip NaN
    bytes through `setFloat{16,32}` and verify `getFloat{16,32}` reads NaN
    back.
    erights already volunteered.

- **[#3156](./issues/3156.md)** — `pass-style` should not treat `document.all`
  as undefined.
  - **Plan:** Apply the patches from the issue body to
    `packages/pass-style/src/passStyle-helpers.js` (`isPrimitive`) and
    `packages/pass-style/src/passStyleOf.js` (route through a strict
    `null`/`undefined` check before `typeof`, then fall through to `'object'`
    for `document.all`).
    Add a regression test that constructs a fake `[[IsHTMLDDA]]`-like value
    via a `Proxy` and asserts `isPrimitive` is false and `passStyleOf` throws
    "Cannot pass non-frozen objects".

- **[#3052](./issues/3052.md)** — `getRankCover(M.kind('copyBag'))` throws.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/patterns/src/patterns/patternMatchers.js` around
    line 939, add `case 'copyBag':` next to `case 'copySet'` and
    `case 'copyMap'` so all three map to pass-style `'tagged'`.
    Add a unit test that calls `getRankCover(M.kind('copyBag'))` and asserts
    it returns the same range as `M.kind('copySet')`.

- **[#3081](./issues/3081.md)** — Dead code in `cli run` command.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/cli/src/commands/run.js`, the inner
    `if (importPath !== undefined)` (around line 93) sits inside the `else`
    branch of an outer `if (importPath !== undefined)` (line 71) and is
    therefore unreachable.
    Delete the inner check and its body; verify
    `yarn workspace @endo/cli test` still passes.

- **[#2390](./issues/2390.md)** — `harden-exports` rule mishandles many
  `export`s.
  **In flight as bots PR #67** (`fix(eslint-plugin): harden-exports
  handles destructuring patterns (#2390)`, branch
  `design/issue-2390-harden-exports-patterns`). Skip; do not open a
  duplicate.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/eslint-plugin/lib/rules/harden-exports.js`, replace
    the ad-hoc traversal at lines 51–61 with a recursive
    `pushDeclaredNames(pattern, names)` helper that handles `Identifier`,
    `ObjectPattern` (using `prop.value`, not `prop.key`, plus `RestElement`),
    `ArrayPattern`, and `AssignmentPattern`.
    Add fixture tests in `packages/eslint-plugin/test/` for each
    non-comprehensive case enumerated in the issue.

- **[#2632](./issues/2632.md)** — Make `harden-exports` aware that
  already-hardened initializers do not need a follow-up `harden`.
  **In flight as bots PR #64** (`feat(eslint-plugin): harden-exports
  skips M.* pattern makers (#2632)`, branch
  `design/issue-2632-harden-exports-pattern-makers`). Skip; do not open
  a duplicate.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/eslint-plugin/lib/rules/harden-exports.js`, when
    collecting `exportNames`, skip names whose initializer is a
    `CallExpression` to a member of `M` (i.e. `M.something(...)`) per
    erights's comment.
    Only require `harden` when the initializer is a literal (function /
    object / array / template).
    Add fixture tests covering `M.string()`, `M.arrayOf(...)`, and a literal
    counter-example that still warns.

- **[#2749](./issues/2749.md)** — Disable `require-param` for `.ts` files.
  **Already merged upstream as endojs/endo#3227.** The bots-side
  mirror PR #66 is CLOSED. Skip; the upstream issue should auto-close
  on the next master sync.
  - **Plan:** Mirror Agoric/agoric-sdk PR #11165: in the root `.eslintrc.cjs`
    (and any `tsconfig.eslint-*` overrides applying to `*.ts`), add an
    override disabling `jsdoc/require-param` and any sibling
    `require-param-*` rules for `*.ts`.
    Confirm `yarn lint` is unchanged on `.js` files and clean on `.ts` files.

- **[#2879](./issues/2879.md)** — Test for per-compartment env-options
  setting and import.
  - **Plan:** Add a test in `packages/ses-ava/test/` (companion to
    `env-options.test.js`) that creates a sub-compartment, sets
    `compartment.globals.process = { env: { ... } }`, imports
    `@endo/env-options` from inside, and asserts the captor reads the
    per-compartment env.
    Also add an analogous test in `packages/marshal/test/` that flips
    `ENDO_RANK_STRINGS` only inside a sub-compartment and verifies string
    ranking differs from the root compartment.

- **[#1845](./issues/1845.md)** — Better diagnostic when bundler's
  `package.json` lacks a `name`.
  - **Plan:** In `packages/compartment-mapper/src/node-modules.js`, harden
    `assertPackageDescriptor` (or the consumption site in `findPackage`/
    `gatherDependency`) to throw
    ```
    makeError(X`package.json at ${q(packageDescriptorLocation)} must have a "name" field; consider naming it after the parent directory`)
    ```
    when `packageDescriptor.name` is missing.
    Add a fixture under `packages/compartment-mapper/test/fixtures-*` with a
    no-name `package.json` and assert the new diagnostic.

- **[#2742](./issues/2742.md)** — Document `Compartment` availability and OOM
  limitations.
  **In flight as bots PR #68** (`docs(ses): document Compartment
  availability and OOM limits (#2742)`, branch
  `design/issue-2742-compartment-limits-doc`). Skip; do not open a
  duplicate.
  - **Plan:** Add a "Limitations" section to `packages/ses/docs/lockdown.md`
    (cross-link a paragraph from `packages/ses/README.md`) describing
    (a) compartments share an agent so an infinite loop in one denies
    availability to others, and
    (b) OOM is observable per the linked TC39 proposal so a malicious
    compartment can trigger OOM in code that calls into it.
    No code changes; lint/markdown checks should still pass.

- **[#2834](./issues/2834.md)** — `bundleSource`'s type signature missing
  `cacheSourceMaps`.
  - **Plan:** Add the `cacheSourceMaps` option to the JSDoc/TS signature in
    `packages/bundle-source/src/types.js` and remove the `@ts-expect-error`
    markers added by #2674.
    Run `yarn docs` from the repo root to confirm typedoc no longer flags
    the option as missing.

## Partial-done — mop-up is ready (3)

- **[#922](./issues/922.md)** — Fix `@agoric/harden` deprecation notice.
  **Plan misclassified — needs maintainer scoping.** `@agoric/harden`
  lives in `agoric-sdk`, not `endojs/endo`. The plan to replace
  `packages/harden/README.md` would actually edit `@endo/harden`'s
  current README (a working ~160-line document, not a deprecated
  package). Maintainer call needed: file something on agoric-sdk,
  add a deprecation paragraph to `@endo/harden`'s README naming
  `@agoric/harden` as the deprecated sibling, or close as
  not-this-repo's-problem.
  - Already done: the package itself is deprecated and instructions tell
    users to use `ses`.
  - **Mop-up plan (do not execute as written):** Replace
    `packages/harden/README.md` with a short deprecation notice that
    names `@endo/harden` and `ses`'s `harden` global, links to the
    migration path, and removes the dummy `index.js` re-export advice.

- **[#1298](./issues/1298.md)** — Some endo tests are not using `@endo/init`.
  **Plan underestimates risk.** 38 test files in
  `packages/compartment-mapper/test/` use bare `import 'ses'`; many
  have a commented-out `// import "./ses-lockdown.js";` indicating
  they previously called `lockdown()` with custom options that were
  intentionally suppressed. Mechanical replacement with
  `import '@endo/init'` (which calls `lockdown()` with defaults)
  changes behavior. Builder B verified: the swap on
  `error-handling.test.js` failed 36 of 45 tests because snapshotted
  error stacks change. Right cut is per-file investigation; that
  exceeds "mop-up" scope. Consider closing as superseded by mhofman's
  note on issue #2711 instead.
  - Already done: many tests have migrated; the remaining offenders are
    enumerated in the issue's third comment (compartment-mapper
    `test-error-handling.js`, `test-transform.js`).
  - **Mop-up plan (do not execute as written):** Replace remaining bare
    `import 'ses'` lines in `packages/compartment-mapper/test/*.js`
    with `import '@endo/init'`, then run the package's tests.
    If any test relies on raw `ses` (e.g. to test `lockdown` taming
    options), leave a comment explaining why.

- **[#947](./issues/947.md)** — iOS Safari fails to lockdown.
  **Regression test landed as bots PR #182** (`test(ses):
  isImmutableDataProperty regression for iOS Safari fix (closes #947)`).
  Awaiting CI + maintainer review.
  - Already done: `packages/ses/src/scope-constants.js` already guards with
    `desc &&` (verified on disk).
  - **Mop-up plan:** Close the issue.
    If a regression test is desired, add a small unit test that calls
    `isImmutableDataProperty(obj, 'absentName')` against a mock object
    reporting `getOwnPropertyNames` includes `absentName` but
    `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` returns undefined; assert it returns
    `false` rather than throwing.

## Skip — needs design (15)

These look small but have an open design question that a maintainer should
adjudicate before agent work begins.

- **#6** — needs maintainer call on whether to publicize
  `cd packages/ses && yarn build` or rebuild docs around lerna.
- **#105** — TC39 proposal.
- **#289** — needs editorial voice/tone choice.
- **#302** — needs erights/kriskowal sketch first.
- **#310** — large doc reorg, no scope.
- **#630** — needs design choice from kumavis's options.
- **#808** — open question whether to delete vs salvage `draft-standalone-spec.md`.
- **#957** — needs decision on where docs live.
- **#2270** — has competing alternative (`/// <reference lib>`).
- **#2649** — Babel visitor root cause needs investigation per maintainer.
- **#2697** — fix tooling vs. `create-package.sh`?
- **#2740** — depends on `@jessie.js/eslint-plugin` interop / ESLint v9 plan.
- **#3007** — turadg recommends sequencing after Agoric #9005.
- **#3071** — erights and gibson042 disagree on repo-wide vs per-package.
- **#3151** — three competing solutions still on the table.
- **#2098** / **#2128** — depend on derivation-vs-random-id design call.
- **#2335** — circumvented in agoric-sdk #9576; needs maintainer call.
- **#2721** — kriskowal noted "no clear motivation yet."
- **#2858** — open design questions about single-failure case + message format.
- **#2891** — kriskowal/erights actively disagreeing on subclass vs `code`.

## Close instead — too small or already done (8)

- **#22** — epic, no scope.
- **#26** — test262 epic.
- **#52** — covered by ECMA-262 Module Namespace Exotic Object proxy
  semantics; redundant test of language spec.
- **#87** — too vague to act on; harden tests have grown substantially since
  2020.
- **#934** — censored-property poisoned getters via #1718 + #2357 already
  throw; close as effectively done.
- **#991** — meta-triage; if upstream issues haven't been migrated in four
  years, they likely won't be.
- **#1240** — kriskowal himself noted the implementation no longer matches
  the test premise.
- **#2331** — verified on disk that `actions/checkout@v4` and
  `actions/setup-node@v6` are pinned everywhere; close as done.

## Suggested handoff sequencing

The Ready bucket is independent — any subset can be handed to parallel
agents.
For sequencing, tackle bug fixes before linter rules so review feedback can
test against a stable baseline:

1. **Quick correctness wins:** #3052, #3081, #3156, #3202.
2. **Lint-rule sweep:** #2390, #2632, #2749 — same package, can land in
   one PR or three.
3. **Doc + diagnostic additions:** #1845, #2742, #2834, #2879.
4. **Mop-up batch:** #922, #947, #1298 — close-or-trivially-fix.

Each item names the package, files, and acceptance test, so a fresh agent
should be able to start coding from the linked issue + this plan alone.
