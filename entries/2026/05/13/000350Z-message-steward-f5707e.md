# Mirrored: process/UNLINKED-TODOS.md

Verbatim. A 2026-05-01 investigator hygiene scan: every `TODO` /
`FIXME` / `XXX` comment in the `endojs/endo` tree paired with the
issue it appears to reference (or "unlinked" if no issue match),
plus a proposed-issue draft for each unlinked TODO. ~133 KB.

The proposed-issue drafts are actionable in the prior garden
(liaison opens them on the maintainer's go-ahead). In this generation
the upstream-side issue-opening is a maintainer action; the steward
will route through the liaison if needed.

# Unlinked TODO comments on actual/master

Snapshot at 2026-05-01 02:06 UTC.  HEAD = `401fd20a21`.

Block-deduped counts: a contiguous comment block containing one or
more TODO/FIXME/XXX tokens counts once.
Raw line count (every line that mentions a token): 396.
CHANGELOG.md files are excluded (their TODO mentions are commit history,
not active markers).

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Total TODO/FIXME/XXX comment blocks in tree | 365 |
| Linked (issue/PR/bug-tracker cited) | 39 |
| Unlinked (need an issue) | 324 |
| Ambiguous (cite a doc/note, not a tracker) | 2 |

Linked rate: **10.7%** (39 of 365 blocks).

## Unlinked TODOs by file

Grouped by package, sorted by file path.

### `@endo/bundle-source`

#### `packages/bundle-source/src/is-entrypoint.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L14** `FIXME: Should maybe be exported by '@endo/something'?`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Promote isEntrypoint to a shared @endo/* utility`

    > `packages/bundle-source/src/is-entrypoint.js:14` defines an
    > `isEntrypoint(href)` helper that determines whether the current module
    > is the script invoked from the command line.
    > Several Endo packages reimplement this idiom.
    > Consider moving the helper into a shared package such as
    > `@endo/where`, `@endo/cli`, or a new utility module so callers can
    > import it instead of duplicating it.

#### `packages/bundle-source/src/script.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L126** `TODO`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Emit a real source map from bundle-source script format`

    > `packages/bundle-source/src/script.js:126` returns a hardened bundle
    > result with `sourceMap: ''`.
    > The script bundler does not currently produce a source map even
    > though the public shape exposes the field.
    > Either populate `sourceMap` with a real value collected from the
    > `sourceMapJobs` accumulator above, or document that the script
    > format intentionally omits source maps and remove the placeholder.

### `@endo/cache-map`

#### `packages/cache-map/src/cachemap.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L140** `TODO?`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Decide whether cache-map should expose richer metrics`

    > `packages/cache-map/src/cachemap.js:140` lists candidate metrics
    > (per-method counts and live/evicted touch statistics with
    > approximate quantiles) that the cache could expose alongside
    > `totalQueryCount` and `totalHitCount`.
    > Decide whether to expand the metrics surface, and if so, settle on
    > a streaming-histogram implementation.
    > If the extended metrics are not desired, delete the speculative
    > comment.

### `@endo/captp`

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Reclassify `@ts-expect-error XXX/FIXME` markers in `@endo/captp`

These typing-debt markers in `packages/captp/src/ts-types.d.ts` (lines
4, 25, 27, 31) suppress `@endo/eventual-send` type imports and a known
constraint mismatch in `Parameters<T[P]>` when `T[P]` is not callable.
Either link each marker to a real type-fixing issue (a single tracker
covering captp's TypeScript debt would be appropriate) or replace the
`FIXME` keyword with a non-TODO marker (for example a doc comment) so
the hygiene scan stops counting them.

#### `packages/captp/src/atomics.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L154** `TODO: It would be nice to use an error type, but captp is just too`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Reduce captp logging noise so trap atomics can throw typed errors`

    > `packages/captp/src/atomics.js:154` notes that the trap host
    > iterator is told to throw `null` rather than a real `Error`
    > because captp emits "Temporary logging of sent error" diagnostics
    > whenever an iterator-throw is observed.
    > Audit the captp send path so that `it.throw(makeError(...))` no
    > longer produces spurious console output, then replace the
    > `it.throw(null)` call with a typed error.

#### `packages/captp/src/captp.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L329** `TODO: fix captp to be compatible with smallcaps`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Make captp compatible with the smallcaps marshalling format`

    > `packages/captp/src/captp.js:329` hard-codes
    > `serializeBodyFormat: 'capdata'` because captp's wire format is
    > not yet compatible with `smallcaps`.
    > Migrate captp's marshalling defaults to `smallcaps`, providing a
    > compatibility shim or version negotiation if existing peers still
    > expect the legacy `capdata` format.

#### `packages/captp/src/finalize.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L78** `it unregisters. TODO If this is not actually guaranteed, i.e., if`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Confirm FinalizationRegistry unregister suppresses pending finalizations`

    > `packages/captp/src/finalize.js:78` assumes that calling
    > `FinalizationRegistry.unregister(key)` synchronously suppresses
    > any pending finalization callback for that key.
    > If finalizations may already have been scheduled at the time of
    > `unregister`, the bookkeeping in `finalizingMap` could delete a
    > newer binding by mistake.
    > Verify the spec and engine behaviors and either rewrite the map
    > to be unregister-race-safe or document the assumption explicitly.
    > Note: the same TODO is duplicated at
    > `packages/ocapn/src/captp/finalize.js:78`.

#### `packages/captp/src/trap.js` — 2 unlinked

- **L57** `TODO: has property is not yet transferrable over captp.`
- **L93** `TODO: has property is not yet transferrable over captp.`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Implement transferrable hasProperty trap over captp`

    > `packages/captp/src/trap.js:57` and `:93` always return `true`
    > from the `has` proxy trap because captp does not yet transmit a
    > `hasProperty` query across the wire.
    > Add a captp message kind for hasProperty, route it through
    > `TrapProxyHandler` and `makeTrapGetterProxy`, and replace the
    > placeholder `return true` with a real synchronous trap.

#### `packages/captp/src/ts-types.d.ts` — 4 unlinked

- **L4** `@ts-expect-error FIXME these aren't defined`
- **L25** `@ts-expect-error FIXME Type 'T[P]' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.`
- **L27** `@ts-expect-error FIXME ditto`
- **L31** `  ? // @ts-expect-error FIXME ditto`
  - See umbrella above:
    `Reclassify @ts-expect-error XXX/FIXME markers in @endo/captp`.

### `@endo/cjs-module-analyzer`

#### `packages/cjs-module-analyzer/index.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L224** `TODO: <!-- XML comment support`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Decide whether cjs-module-analyzer should support legacy <!-- XML --> comments`

    > `packages/cjs-module-analyzer/index.js:224` flags the `<` token in
    > the analyzer's tokenizer with a TODO about supporting legacy
    > `<!--` HTML-style comments that some annex-B environments accept
    > inside CommonJS scripts.
    > Confirm whether the analyzer needs to recognize HTML-style
    > comments at all (modern CommonJS rarely uses them), and either
    > implement the case or delete the TODO.

### `@endo/cli`

#### `packages/cli/demo/cat.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L756** `TODO await (and respect cancellation)`
  - **Proposed issue:** `cat demo: await promise values when rendering passable trees`

    > `packages/cli/demo/cat.js:756` renders a `promise` passable as a
    > literal hourglass glyph rather than awaiting and rendering the
    > resolved value.
    > Update the renderer to await the promise (subject to a
    > cancellation signal) and substitute the resolved DOM node when
    > settled.

#### `packages/cli/src/client.js` — 2 unlinked

- **L24** `    return await /** @type {any} XXX EndoBootstrap not exported */ (`
- **L36** `    return /** @type {any} XXX EndoBootstrap not exported */ (`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Export EndoBootstrap so cli/client.js does not need any-cast`

    > `packages/cli/src/client.js:24` and `:36` cast `makeEndoClient`'s
    > result to `any` because the `EndoBootstrap` type is not exported
    > from `@endo/daemon`.
    > Export the `EndoBootstrap` (and any related host bootstrap)
    > types from the daemon's public types module, then drop the two
    > `any` casts in the CLI client.

#### `packages/cli/src/commands/install.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L32** `TODO alternately, make a temporary session-scoped GC pet store`
- See umbrella issue:
  `Provide a session-scoped temporary pet store for cli install/make`
  (also covers `packages/cli/src/commands/make.js:51`).

  > `packages/cli/src/commands/install.js:32` and
  > `packages/cli/src/commands/make.js:51` both generate
  > `tmp-bundle-<hex>` pet names when the user did not supply
  > `bundleName`.
  > These names accumulate in the persistent pet store.
  > Add a session-scoped pet store that overshadows the permanent
  > one and is implicitly dropped when the CapTP session ends, then
  > stop manufacturing `tmp-bundle-*` names in the install and make
  > commands.

#### `packages/cli/src/commands/make.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L51** `TODO alternately, make a temporary session-scoped GC pet store`
  - See `packages/cli/src/commands/install.js:32` for the proposed
    umbrella issue.

### `@endo/common`

#### `packages/common/test/object-meta-assign.test.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L7** `TODO more testing`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Expand objectMetaAssign tests beyond a single happy path`

    > `packages/common/test/object-meta-assign.test.js:7` covers only
    > one trivial case for `objectMetaAssign`.
    > Add coverage for property descriptor merging, accessor
    > properties, non-enumerable keys, symbol keys, and prototype
    > preservation so the helper's documented contract is exercised.

### `@endo/compartment-mapper`

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/README.md` — 13 unlinked

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Track future-version TODOs in `compartment-mapper/README.md`

The `compartment-mapper` README enumerates roadmap items inline using
`> TODO:` admonitions and bare `// TODO` comments inside the
`CompartmentMap` type sketch (lines 71, 351, 354, 367, 449, 453, 468,
589, 618, 637, 729, 736, 764).
The themes are:

> 1. distributing global and built-in choices to third-party packages
>    (LavaMoat parity, line 71);
> 2. respecting `imports` (351) and wildcard patterns in `exports` and
>    `imports` (354);
> 3. acting on the `package.json` `files` globs and exposing
>    per-compartment file access (367);
> 4. respecting import-map properties (449);
> 5. source-to-source translators in `package.json` (453);
> 6. compartment-map plugins for `devDependencies` (468);
> 7. defining the `Realm`/`realms` shape and lockdown options
>    (589, 618, 729, 736);
> 8. clarifying that an absent `compartment` name may mean either an
>    internal alias or a user-supplied module (637);
> 9. reaching policy parity with LavaMoat's `policy.json` (764).
>
> Likely overlap with endojs/endo#2388 for `exports`/`imports`
> conditions.
> Maintainer should split the list into individual issues (or link
> existing ones), and either inline the issue references in the
> README or strip the TODO comments entirely once they are tracked
> elsewhere.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/bundle-cjs.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L33** `TODO: specifier not found handling`
  - **Proposed issue:** `bundle-cjs runtime require: surface a clear error when specifier is unknown`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/bundle-cjs.js:33` builds a
    > `requireImpl(specifier)` that does
    > `cells[imports[specifier]].default.get()` without checking that
    > `imports[specifier]` is defined.
    > Add an explicit "module not found" error path so a missing
    > specifier produces a recognizable runtime error rather than a
    > "Cannot read property of undefined" stack.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/capture-lite.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L160** `TODO: A mapping of canonical name to compartment name is generated by`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Expose canonical-name to compartment-name mapping from mapNodeModules`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/capture-lite.js:160` recomputes
    > the canonical-name to compartment-name mapping by scanning
    > `compartmentMap.compartments` because the mapping that
    > `mapNodeModules()` already builds is not exposed.
    > Surface the mapping as either an out-parameter on
    > `mapNodeModules()` or an option on `captureFromMap()` so the
    > redundant scan in `capture-lite.js` can be removed.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/compartment-map.js` — 2 unlinked

- **L34** `TODO convert to the new '||' assert style.`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Migrate compartment-map.js error messages to assert.details/X tagged templates`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/compartment-map.js:34` notes
    > that the file uses plain template strings and a local
    > `q = JSON.stringify` helper instead of the modern `assert(cond,
    > X\`...\`)` / `assert.quote` idiom used elsewhere in Endo.
    > Convert the file's assertions to the standard pattern so error
    > messages participate in the structured-errors machinery.
- **L598** `TODO: It may be prudent to assert that there exists some module referring`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Assert that each compartment has at least one module referring to it`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/compartment-map.js:598` calls
    > out a missing structural check inside the compartment-map
    > validator: there is currently no assertion that every named
    > compartment is actually referred to by some module entry.
    > Add the assertion (or document why orphan compartments are
    > legal) so malformed maps are rejected closer to the source.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/hooks.md` — 1 unlinked

- **L93** `> [TODO]`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Update hooks.md bundle/archive diagram once hook integration lands`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/hooks.md:93` carries a `[TODO]`
    > admonition to copy the bundle-and-archive subgraph into the
    > main hook diagram once the bundle and archive entry points
    > start passing hooks.
    > Either update `bundle.js` and `archive.js` to thread hooks
    > through and refresh the diagram, or remove the placeholder
    > diagram if hook coverage there is not on the roadmap.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/infer-exports.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L207** `TODO Otherwise, glob 'files' for all '.js', '.cjs', and '.mjs' entry`
  - **Proposed issue:** `inferExports: glob package.json files for entry modules when exports is absent`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/infer-exports.js:207` notes
    > that when neither `main` nor `exports` is provided, the
    > compartment mapper should fall back to globbing the
    > `package.json` `files` field for `.js`, `.cjs`, and `.mjs`
    > entry modules (excluding `node_modules`).
    > Implement the glob fallback so legacy packages that rely on
    > `files` continue to expose their entry points.

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/link.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L64** `TODO: can we just use 'Object.hasOwn' instead?`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Replace local has() helper in link.js with Object.hasOwn`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/link.js:64` defines a private
    > `has(object, key)` helper using `Function.prototype.apply` and

    > Decide on the canonical shape, document which fields are truly

#### `packages/compartment-mapper/src/policy-format.js` — 1 unlinked

- **L343** `TODO: Shouldn't need type assertions here`
  - **Proposed issue:** `Eliminate redundant type assertion on isEmptyObject in policy-format.js`

    > `packages/compartment-mapper/src/policy-format.js:343` casts

- **L678** `@ts-expect-error XXX TS2345`
  - See umbrella below:
    `Reclassify @ts-expect-error XXX markers in @endo/compartment-mapper`.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Reclassify `@ts-expect-error XXX` markers in `@endo/compartment-mapper`

The two `@ts-expect-error XXX TS2345` markers in
`packages/compartment-mapper/test/scaffold.js` (lines 617 and 678) sit
on `test(name, async (t, Compartment) => {...})` calls.
They suppress AVA's overload selection complaint when the test
implementation accepts an extra `Compartment` argument supplied by an
AVA macro.
Either teach the test scaffold's typings about the macro signature so
the suppressions become unnecessary, or replace the `XXX` keyword with
a non-TODO marker (for example a doc comment) so the hygiene scan
stops counting them.

#### `packages/daemon/src/daemon.js` — 8 unlinked

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Daemon TODO sweep across `daemon.js` bootstrap path

The 8 unlinked TODOs in `packages/daemon/src/daemon.js` cluster around
the daemon bootstrap and formulation surface area:

> 1. L488 `makeEval`: when an eval result is plain data, optionally
>    promote the resolution into the content-addressed store and
>    truncate the dependency chain (potentially by racing two
>    formulas).
> 2. L527, L550 `makeUnconfined` and `makeBundle` cast `powers` and
>    `farContext` through `any` because the worker daemon facet's
>    types are not yet precise.
> 3. L1344 `addPeerInfo` short-circuits when a peer is already known
>    instead of merging the inbound connection info.
> 4. L2310 `formulatePeer` skips validation of `addresses` and stores
>    mutable address state in the formula.
> 5. L2433 `makePeer` connects on the first supported address rather
>    than racing supported networks (with retry/back-off and
>    invalidation on connection loss).
> 6. L2506 `accept`-invitation flow needs to confirm that
>    `formulaGraphJobs.enqueue()` is sufficient to cancel the
>    previous incarnation and revoke the invitation.
> 7. L2753 `makeDaemon` hardcodes `gracePeriodMs = 100` instead of
>    threading the value through command arguments.

These themes are cohesive: the daemon's bootstrap and peer pathways
need a focused review to land them. Either split into one issue per
TODO or open a single tracker covering the daemon TODO sweep.

- **L488** `TODO check whether the promise resolves to data that can be marshalled`
- **L527** `TODO fix type`
- **L550** `TODO fix type`
- **L1344** `TODO: merge connection info`

  - **Proposed issue:** `Thread Context through makeIdentifiedDirectory`

    > `packages/daemon/src/directory.js:297` declares

    > `context` argument is destructured and never used.
    > Plumb `context` into the directory's lifetime management so
    > sub-resources (pet store, child directories) inherit
    > cancellation and disposal.

#### `packages/daemon/src/mail.js` — 3 unlinked

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Validate request messages and add reject coverage in mail.js

`packages/daemon/src/mail.js` has three TODOs in the same handler:

> 1. L497 `respond` casts `message` to `Request` without validating
>    its shape.
> 2. L505 there is no test for the `reject` path.
> 3. L511 `reject` similarly casts `message` without verifying it is
>    a request.
>
> Add a runtime shape guard (using `@endo/patterns` matchers) for
> request messages, share it between `respond` and `reject`, then
> add an AVA test that exercises rejection of an outstanding request.

- **L497** `TODO validate shape of request`
- **L505** `TODO test reject`
- **L511** `TODO verify that the message is a request.`

#### `packages/daemon/src/networks/tcp-netstring.js` — 5 unlinked

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Bring up the tcp-netstring network device's request and logging hygiene

`packages/daemon/src/networks/tcp-netstring.js` has five TODOs that
cluster into a single bring-up effort:

> 1. L33 a stub `request('port to listen for public web socket
>    connections')` call is commented out.
> 2. L50 the `request()` API is awkward to respond to and lacks
>    defaults, type hints, and validation.
> 3. L68 the assigned port is not logged.
> 4. L85 and L144 inbound and outbound connection logs omit the
>    listen and connect addresses.
>
> Tighten the device's bootstrap so it requests the listening
> address through a typed prompt, logs the assigned port and the
> peer addresses on accept and connect, and adds basic shape
> validation to `request()`.

- **L33** `TODO`
- **L50** `TODO make responding to this less of a pain.`
- **L68** `TODO log assigned port`
- **L85** `TODO listen and connect addresses should be logged`

#### `packages/daemon/src/serve-private-port-http.js` — 3 unlinked

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Finish the daemon's serve-private-port-http endpoints

`packages/daemon/src/serve-private-port-http.js` has three TODOs in
the private HTTP path:

> 1. L37 the `/bootstrap.js` route should be served by a readable
>    mutable file formula with a file watcher rather than recursing
>    into the bootstrap to fetch the script.
> 2. L60 the `connect()` handler needs to select an attenuated
>    bootstrap based on the subdomain instead of using the full
>    bootstrap.
> 3. L87 the bootstrap pings the web client once on connect; the
>    daemon should set up a heart-monitor for liveness.
>
> Land these together (mutable-file formula plus subdomain-scoped
> attenuation plus heart monitor) since they all reshape the same
> private HTTP serving path. Note the same pattern repeats in
> `packages/daemon/src/web-server-node.js`.

`packages/eslint-plugin/lib/rules/harden-exports.js` lines 50, 52, 81,
and 84 suppress AST type errors because the rule walks
`exportNode.declaration.declarations[i]`, `declaration.id.name`, and
`statement.expression.callee.name` without narrowing the ESLint AST
union types.
Either narrow the AST nodes explicitly using ESTree's discriminated
unions (so the suppressions become unnecessary) or replace the `xxx`
keyword with a non-TODO marker (for example a doc comment) so the
hygiene scan stops counting them.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Reclassify `@ts-expect-error XXX/FIXME` markers in `@endo/eventual-send`

`@ts-expect-error` markers in `@endo/eventual-send` (E.js lines 211,
225, 249, and `eventual-send.test.js:14`) suppress complaints about
proxy constructor signatures and the missing `test.onFinish` typing on
AVA's exported test object.
The cross-cutting note in this report points out that the proxy ones
are downstream of microsoft/TypeScript#61838.
Either link each marker to a real type-fixing tracker (the upstream
TypeScript issue for the proxy ones, an AVA typing PR for `onFinish`)

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Consolidate `isPrimitive` across `@endo` packages

Four packages duplicate an `isPrimitive(val)` helper because the

> Each TODO points at the existing `isPrimitive` in
> `@endo/pass-style` and notes the layering constraint.
> Decide on a layer-bottom utility package (for example

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Tighten dot-membrane converter typing and revocation

`packages/marshal/src/dot-membrane.js` collects three TODOs around the
membrane-converter machinery:

> 1. L21 `makeConverter` accepts a `mirrorConverter` typed as `any`
>    and notes that a real `Converter` type should be defined.
> 2. L59 the cross-side promise-rejection path catches a
>    `metaReason` that is then passed back through `pass`; verify
>    that `metaReason` is provably my-side-safe (or that the
>    pass-back is your-side-safe).
> 3. L78 the `myMethodToYours` closure captures `mineIf` from the
>    outer scope, which means revocation cannot be observed for
>    GC.  Restructure the scoping so that post-revoke garbage
>    collection of `mine` is observable.
>
> Land these together since they all sharpen the membrane's
> security and performance contract.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: encodeToCapData: canonical-JSON ordering, byteArray, deprecated qclass cleanup, Hilbert rest assertion

the encoder's ordering and shape concerns:

> 1. L110 the implementation depends on the textual order of object

>    removed once no senders rely on it.
> 4. L409 the Hilbert-Hotel `rest` decoding does not assert that
>    `passStyleOf(rest)` is `'copyRecord'` because hardening would
>    be premature.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Memoize and consolidate keys-collection duplicate detection in `@endo/patterns`

`packages/patterns/src/keys/copyBag.js:29` and
`packages/patterns/src/keys/copySet.js:29` carry the same TODO:
the duplicate-detection helpers re-enumerate the entire array on each
call. If profiling confirms the cost matters, memoize the
no-duplicate finding independent of the `fullOrder` used to reach it.
A single change set that adds the memo to both helpers (and shares
the underlying `confirmNoDuplicates` machinery) is more efficient
than two independent issues.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Adopt `&&=` and `||=` operators across `@endo/patterns` keys helpers

`packages/patterns/src/keys/copyBag.js:38` and
`packages/patterns/src/keys/copySet.js:38` both note that once tooling
support is uniform, the `fullCompare = fullCompare || ...` lines

operators, then sweep the patterns codebase converting in-place.

>    guards (placeholder URL only).

##### Proposed umbrella issue: patternMatchers cleanup pass: rank covers, MatchHelper parameterization, and difference accumulation

`packages/patterns/src/patterns/patternMatchers.js` has 8 TODO and XXX
markers along the same matcher pipeline:

> 1. L1 file-level "TODO parameterize MatchHelper" preceding a
>    blanket `eslint-disable no-continue`. The work would let many
>    of the file's other helpers drop the disable.
> 2. L377 `confirmPatternInternal` parallels `confirmKey` and they
>    should share more logic.
> 3. L531 record-pattern matching uses two `listDifference` calls;
>    a single iter-disjoint-union pass would be cheaper.
> 4. L681, L693, L720, L742 four `XXX this doesn't get along with
>    the world of cover === pair of strings` markers in the
>    `getRankCover` switch document a regression introduced when
>    rank covers were redefined as string pairs (also flagged as
>    a "POSSIBLE SILENT CORRECTNESS BUG" in the same block).
> 5. L1035 `match:nat` rank cover is conservative ("Could be more
>    precise"); a tighter cover would shorten range queries.
>
> Issue 4 is the most consequential (silent correctness bug); the
> rest are good cleanup that the same change set could address.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: SES permits cleanup: future intrinsics, engine quirks, and Promise.delegate transition

`packages/ses/src/permits.js` carries 12 TODOs that fall into three
clusters:

> 1. Future intrinsics not yet permitted, awaiting standards or
>    SES policy:
>    - L92 `DisposableStack`, `AsyncDisposableStack`
>    - L97 `ShadowRealm`
>    - L167, L190 `Temporal` (start vs shared)
>    - L689, L703 `SuppressedError` and its prototype
>    - L701 `AggregateError.errors` permit
> 2. Engine-quirk workarounds:
>    - L335 Hermes-specific `caller`/`arguments` patch
>    - L576, L578 QuickJS `fileName` and `lineNumber` getters
>      should be grabbed for console use
>    - L668 `Error.prototype.at` "proposed de-facto, assumed
>      TODO" placeholder
> 3. L1612 the `HandledPromise` global will be replaced by
>    `Promise.delegate`.
>
> Land each cluster as a separate change set rather than 12
> issues: the future-intrinsic permits are blocked on standards
> progress, the engine quirks share a feature-detect pattern, and
> the Promise.delegate transition has its own TC39 timing.

##### Proposed umbrella issue: Reconcile SES test262 cross-realm and noStrict exclusions with realm/sloppy support plans

Five SES test262 harness scripts exclude the `cross-realm` feature

does not create realms or support sloppy mode:

> 5. `packages/ses/test262/tame-global-regexp-object.js:34`

## Ambiguous TODOs (cite a doc or external note, not a tracker)

- `packages/ses/src/make-eval-function.js:19` `TODO Recent proposals from Mike Samuel may change this non-string`
- `packages/ses/src/permits.js:118` `  HandledPromise: 'HandledPromise', // TODO: Until Promise.delegate (see below).`

## Suggested follow-ups

### Cross-cutting patterns

- **TypeScript error-suppression markers (`@ts-expect-error XXX <reason>`,
  `@ts-ignore XXX <reason>`, `@ts-nocheck XXX <reason>`)** account for
  ~38 of the unlinked entries (mostly in `@endo/pass-style/test/passStyleOf.test.js`,
  `@endo/marshal/src/{marshal,encodeToSmallcaps}.js`,
  `@endo/eventual-send/src/E.js`, `@endo/module-source/src/transform-*.js`,
  and `@endo/compartment-mapper/test/scaffold.js`).
  These are not really TODOs; they are typing debt. Consider an umbrella
  issue "replace `@ts-expect-error XXX` markers with proper types" and
  link the umbrella from each site, or treat them as a known accepted
  pattern and stop tagging them with XXX.
- **`@endo/compartment-mapper/README.md`** has 13 unlinked `> TODO:` notes
  describing future spec coverage (`exports`/`imports` patterns, `files`
  globs, lockdown options, plugins). Likely candidates for
  endojs/endo#2388 (graceful tags-to-conditions migration) and a generic
  "compartment-mapper README parity tracker" umbrella issue.
- **`@endo/ses/src/permits.js`** has 12 unlinked TODOs about engine quirks
  (XS, Hermes, JSC, QuickJS) — a single "taming-permits cleanup" tracking
  issue would group these.
- **`@endo/patterns/src/patterns/{patternMatchers,getGuardPayloads}.js`**
  has 17 unlinked TODOs across two files; likely covered by an existing
  patterns redesign discussion. Maintainer should confirm whether
  endojs/endo#1737 covers them.
- **`@endo/zip/src/format-writer.js`** has 7 unlinked TODOs that all read
  like spec-conformance gaps ("verify", "check", "truncate").
  One "zip writer spec-compliance" tracking issue is more useful than
  individual issues.
- **`@endo/daemon/src/daemon.js`** has 8 unlinked TODOs across the
  daemon's bootstrap path. The daemon is still under active development
  per AGENTS.md, so an architectural "daemon TODO sweep" is reasonable.
- **`@endo/ses/src/error/tame-v8-error-constructor.js`** has 7 unlinked
  TODOs that look like V8-specific quirks; many already cite Chromium
  bugs in nearby comments — the maintainer should re-grep this file for
  bug numbers that are present a few lines away from the TODO line.

### Likely-known-issue candidates (worth re-confirming, do not auto-link)

- TODOs in `@endo/compartment-mapper` that reference `exports`/`imports`
  conditions or wildcards likely overlap with endojs/endo#2388.
- TODOs in `@endo/eventual-send/src/E.js` about callable type-mapping
  cite microsoft/TypeScript#61838 in linked siblings; the unlinked
  `@ts-expect-error XXX typedef` lines are downstream of the same gap.
- TODOs in `@endo/ses/src/strict-scope-terminator.js`, `eval-strict.js`,
  and surrounding tame-error files mention "JSC" / "Safari" / "Hermes";
  some have linked-sibling comments referencing endojs/endo#1490 etc.
  that the comment block probably should pull in.

### Probable dead-letter (consider deletion rather than tracking)

- `@endo/exo/test/non-enumerable-methods.test.js:44` — "FIXME typedef
  should catch bad arg" — single-line stale FIXME with no context.
- `@endo/module-source/test/_native.js:3` — `@ts-expect-error XXX
  typedef` in test scaffolding; if the test still passes, the XXX is
  not actionable as a TODO.
- Various single-line `XXX module exports fail if these aren't in scope`
  comments in `@endo/errors/index.js`, `@endo/eventual-send/src/no-shim.js`
  describe an existing safety check, not future work.
- `@endo/zip/test/zip.test.js:28` — `XXX would use optional chaining
  but it's currently forbidding 2025-05-28` — date-stamped reminder
  about a tooling restriction; either link to the upstream issue
  blocking optional chaining, or delete once the restriction lifts.

## Notes on hygiene

- The bulk of unlinked TODOs are concentrated in
  `@endo/ses` (60), `@endo/pass-style`
  (40), `@endo/patterns`
  (38), `@endo/daemon`
  (34), `@endo/marshal`
  (34), and `@endo/compartment-mapper`
  (33).
- Only **10.7%** of TODO/FIXME/XXX blocks reference an issue
  or PR; this is below typical engineering-hygiene targets (often 60-80%).
  A large share of the gap is `@ts-expect-error XXX <reason>` markers,
  which arguably should be reclassified as accepted typing debt rather
  than tracked individually.
- Recommend filing one umbrella issue per file in the "3+ unlinked"
  cluster list above, and adopting a convention that any new TODO must
  cite an issue (enforceable via a lightweight ESLint rule or grep CI check).
