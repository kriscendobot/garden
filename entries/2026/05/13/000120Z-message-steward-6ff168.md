# Mirrored: process/tracking/120.md

Verbatim. The only per-issue tracking file the prior liaison left
open: issue #120 is a recurring review-priority dashboard where the
maintainer asks for a roadmap-priority refresh on demand. The bot's
report lives in-place at issuecomment-4399837605; refreshes PATCH the
existing comment rather than create new ones.

The "Next refresh trigger" is the next explicit ask from kriskowal or
the settling of the M1 batch (designs #163 #164 #165 #162 plus
#122 / #142 re-reviews). In this generation of the garden, the
researcher subagent that produces the refresh is not available; if
kriskowal asks, the steward should route the request to the liaison
for builder-equivalent dispatch in the prior garden, or for direct
action by the maintainer.

The issue serves as a recurring review-priority dashboard for kriskowal.
The bot's report is at issuecomment-4399837605 and is updated in-place via PATCH (not new comments).
The maintainer has explicitly directed in-place updates.

## Outstanding

- **Next refresh trigger**: refresh on explicit ask, or when the next M1 batch settles
  (the M1 design follow-ups #163, #164, #165, #162 + the #122 / #142 re-review cycle).
  Detection heuristic for "M1 batch settled": when the design follow-ups
  (#163, #164, #165, #162) and the #122 / #142 re-reviews either merge
  or hit a stable APPROVED + green-CI state with no open CHANGES_REQUESTED.

- **Two priority-list PRs closed without merge** between the prior refresh and this one:
  #130 (split into #144 HttpClient + #145 IntervalScheduler) and #114
  (compartment-mapper @endo/errors mirror).
  Tracked here in case the maintainer asks why they fell off the list.
