# Mirrored: process/ROLES-SKILLS-AUDIT.md

Verbatim. Roles/skills audit from the prior garden's library. Lists
each role and skill with its date of last meaningful edit, the
role's primary skill citations, and any drift between the role's
prose and the skills it cites. Useful as a porting checklist if the
liaison chooses to bring more of the prior library into the active
set.

# Roles and skills editorial audit

Date: 2026-05-04.
Scope: bring `roles/*.md` and `skills/*.md` into alignment with
the trigger-and-filter convention (`skills/README.md`), the PR
body discipline (`skills/pre-pr-checklist.md`), the closed-PR
and Claude-attribution rules (`CLAUDE.md`), and the em-dash
prose rule (`skills/em-dash-style-rule.md`).

This pass is editorial, not a rewrite.
The engagement was capped at eight substantive commits to keep
the work focused; broader systemic findings are recorded here
for a follow-up dispatch.

## Pass 1: trigger-and-filter compliance

### Roles whose `## Skills` list lacks per-skill trigger lines

These role files list their cited skills as bare paths or with
only a noun-fragment tag, leaving the reader no signal about
when to follow the link.
The convention (parent overbroad, child filter-narrow) wants a
one-sentence trigger per cited skill.

- `roles/cleaner.md`: bare list of seven skill paths, no trigger
  lines. Fixed in this engagement.
- `roles/saboteur.md`: bare list of five skill paths, no trigger
  lines. Fixed in this engagement.
- `roles/stratego.md`: skill list uses noun-fragment tags
  ("the per-commit `git log` recipes...") rather than trigger
  lines. Fixed in this engagement.
- `roles/groom.md`: skill list mostly bare (one entry has the
  em-dash continuation). Fixed in this engagement.

### Roles whose `## Skills` list already follows the convention

`builder`, `conductor`, `designer`, `fixer`, `investigator`,
`juror`, `maestro`, `scout`, `shepherd`, `steward`, `triager`,
`weaver` all carry per-skill trigger lines.

### Skill files that lead with an explicit trigger

Most skills lead with `## When to use`, `## Trigger`,
`## Triggers`, `## The rule`, `## Principle`, or `## The
error`. All work as triggers; the variation in heading is
cosmetic.

`pre-pr-checklist.md` previously opened with `## The minimum`
(no trigger heading). Fixed in this engagement: a `## Trigger`
section now leads, explicitly covering both `gh pr create` and
`gh pr edit --body` paths.

### Skills that have accreted unrelated pitfalls

The exemplar refactor was `review-feedback-followup-commits.md`,
which extracted `verify-upstream-state-before-pinning.md` and
`package-rename-cascade.md` as focused siblings.

No other skill currently shows the same accretion symptom.
`shepherd.md`'s `## Recurring patterns` section is a near-miss
(four pitfalls of distinct shapes), but it lives in a role file
where the inlining is appropriate; the candidates that would
extract cleanly are the dependabot-Prettier and unmasked-second-
failure entries, both of which are CI-shepherding-specific. Not
fixed; not flagged either.

## Pass 2: PR-body discipline

- No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` strings in any role or skill file.
- No example PR bodies cite `skills/<file>.md` or
  `roles/<file>.md` paths.
- The only example PR body content is in
  `skills/pr-mirror-for-offline-review.md`, which describes the
  mirror PR substance (upstream PR number, author handle,
  reviewer instructions). No methodology leak.

No commits required for this pass.

## Pass 3: closed-PR and Claude-workflow rules

- `roles/steward.md` already restates the closed-PR rule
  ("dispatches only against PRs whose `state` is `OPEN`",
  lines 60-65). No other role gives an example that would act
  on a closed PR or issue.
- No role or skill includes an example involving a
  `.github/workflows/claude*.yml` file.

No commits required for this pass.

## Pass 4: em-dashes in prose

The em-dash audit splits into three populations:

### Legitimate uses (do not sweep)

- Skill-list separators in `roles/README.md` and
  `skills/README.md`. Pre-existing convention; out of scope per
  the engagement brief.
- Role files that mirror the convention in their own `## Skills`
  list (builder, designer, fixer, investigator, juror, maestro,
  namer, scout, shepherd, triager, weaver). The dash separates
  the link target from a one-line trigger; replacing it with a
  colon would be the cleaner long-term shape but is too large a
  diff for an alignment audit.
- Em-dashes inside code formatting: `roles/steward.md` line 239
  (`grep "—"` literal), `skills/em-dash-style-rule.md`'s entire
  body (the rule references the character).

### Em-dashes in role-file intro prose

Recently-added intro paragraphs that snuck the character past
the rule:

- `roles/builder.md` line 3
- `roles/cleaner.md` lines 34, 36, 39
- `roles/designer.md` line 4
- `roles/groom.md` lines 19, 121, 122
- `roles/investigator.md` lines 3, 5
- `roles/juror.md` line 3
- `roles/namer.md` line 3 (intro), line 84 (skill list)
- `roles/scout.md` lines 3, 4

These are the load-bearing fixes in this engagement.

### Em-dashes in skill-file prose (systemic)

Pervasive across the skill corpus:
`benchmark-comparative-report.md`, `pr-mirror-for-offline-review.md`,
`rebase-hygiene-audit.md`, `pre-pr-checklist.md`,
`groom-open-questions.md`, `self-improvement.md`,
`conflict-resolution.md`, `panel-review-12-perspectives.md`,
`adversarial-tests.md`, `todo-link-classification.md`,
`coverage-driven-testing.md`, `process-documents.md`,
`babel-visitor-exhaustiveness.md`, `prompt-section-discovery.md`,
`dependency-graph-maintenance.md`.

Sweeping all of these exceeds the eight-commit cap.
Flagged for a follow-up dispatch dedicated to the em-dash sweep
across the skill corpus; the substitution choices (period vs.
parens vs. colon) are per-sentence judgment calls and reading
the prose is the load-bearing step.

## Cross-cutting observations

### Heading convention drift

Skill files use any of `## When to use`, `## Trigger`,
`## Triggers`, `## When`, `## The rule`, `## Principle`, etc.
to introduce the trigger.
A future pass could standardize on `## Trigger` (singular) per
the recently-trimmed exemplars
`review-feedback-followup-commits.md`,
`verify-upstream-state-before-pinning.md`, and
`package-rename-cascade.md`.

### Self-improvement boilerplate

Every role file ends with the same six-line "Self-improvement"
paragraph that repeats `skills/self-improvement.md`'s contract.
The repetition is fine when the role is read in isolation, but
every role-file edit reverberates through fifteen identical
copies.
A future pass could replace the per-role boilerplate with a
single short pointer at the canonical skill, paid for once at
the index.

### `roles/README.md` vs. `CLAUDE.md` role index

The two indexes drift because both restate the role list with
trigger lines.
The `CLAUDE.md` index is curated by the user directly per the
engagement brief.
A future pass could collapse one into the other (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`
points at `roles/README.md` for the trigger lines and only lists
the names) so role additions edit one file, not two.
