# Mirrored: process/PR-DISPATCH-STATE.md

Verbatim per-cycle PR snapshot, rewritten in full each conductor
cycle by the prior steward. The most recent cycle entry is the
2026-05-10 PR 142 merge; the file accumulates cycle entries in
reverse chronological order. This is the rolling state that the
prior watchman-cadence used to decide active-vs-idle mode. Roughly
49 KB.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 142)

PR 142 merged → `0945a3aaef6971588e37fbe2ab2c6a701170d553` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T17:35:04Z.
`feat(bytes): @endo/bytes package for platform-neutral byte operations`,
the implementation of the design landed in PR 140 (a small leaf package
providing `concatBytes`, `bytesEqual`, `bytesFromText`, `bytesToText` on
`Uint8Array` with `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` captured once at module
load).
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 2026-05-10T17:18:34Z), MERGEABLE/CLEAN,
29/29 CI SUCCESS at head `03244bf0a4` (6-commit per-package shape;
title and body recently reauthored to be merge-commit-ready per
kriskowal's directive). No rebase needed (CLEAN); tidy already done
(per-package shape is the intended cluster). Merge-commit title and
body sourced from the PR per the 2026-05-10 repo settings change
(`merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE`, `merge_commit_message=PR_BODY`).
Direct `gh pr merge 142 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch`; state=MERGED on first verify. Local
`feat/endo-bytes` branch deleted; remote branch deleted via
`--delete-branch`; worktrees `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-142` and
`/home/kris/endo-wt/feat-endo-bytes` removed; safety tags
`pr142-pre-reshape`, `pr142-pre-perpkg-reshape`, `pr142-pre-resplit`,
`pr142-pre-reshape-4`, `pr142-pre-perpkg-resplit` deleted.

**Follow-up needed (steward to dispatch)**: kriskowal asked at
2026-05-10T17:19:20Z for a follow-up PR replaying this change on
`actual/master` (upstream `endojs/endo`). Next steward cycle should
dispatch a builder for the upstream replay: port the per-package shape
of `@endo/bytes` to upstream master, plus the call-site adoption that
retired duplicated helpers in `packages/platform/src/fs-node/`.
Reference merge commit on `bots-ssh/llm`:
`0945a3aaef6971588e37fbe2ab2c6a701170d553`.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 140)

PR 140 merged → `d5b50506605009e772bf49032ff0f744ab7a30e3` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T11:07:33Z.
`design(bytes): @endo/bytes package for Uint8Array helpers`, docs-only
design proposing a small leaf package providing `concatBytes`,
`bytesEqual`, `bytesFromText`, and `bytesToText` for platform-neutral
byte handling, retiring duplicated helpers in
`packages/platform/src/fs-node/`. Built on `Uint8Array` with
`TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` captured once at module load.
At survey: APPROVED, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 28/28 CI SUCCESS at head
`469082d216` (single consolidated commit per kriskowal directive;
rebased after #164 merged with conflict resolution in
`designs/README.md`). No rebase needed (CLEAN); tidy skipped (already
consolidated to a single commit). Merge-commit title and body sourced
from the PR per the 2026-05-10 repo settings change
(`merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE`, `merge_commit_message=PR_BODY`).
Direct `gh pr merge 140 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch`; state=MERGED on first verify. Local
`design/endo-bytes` branch and remote branch deleted; worktree
`/home/kris/endo-wt/design-endo-bytes` removed; safety tag
`pr140-pre-consolidate` deleted.

Downstream: PR 142 (`feat(bytes): @endo/bytes package`) is the
implementation of this design and the obvious next merge candidate
once it is review-ready. Worktree `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-142`,
branch `feat/endo-bytes` at `e33273682e`. Steward to verify CI / review
state and dispatch a weaver (PR 142 will now be behind base by at
least one merge commit) before considering for the queue.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 164)

PR 164 merged → `62ae0d27011f59ce3957e0ff78685269e2407233` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T08:25:35Z.
`design(cap-policy): trust-on-first-bind for capability-policy bindings
(PR #144 addendum)`, docs-only design proposing a TOFU adapter for
allowlist-bearing capability bindings (origins, paths, commands), as
follow-up to a PR #144 inline review request.
At survey: APPROVED, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 34 behind / 2 ahead
`bots-ssh/llm`, 28/28 CI SUCCESS at head `337329bdd0`. The earlier
macos-15 flake had cleared by survey time; no rerun needed.
GitHub reported MERGEABLE/CLEAN despite the 34-behind delta (the merge
commit absorbs the base advance), so no rebase performed; tidy skipped
(single-commit, coherent docs-only PR with authoritative title and
body). Merge-commit title and body now sourced from the PR per the
2026-05-10 repo settings change (`merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE`,
`merge_commit_message=PR_BODY`).
Direct `gh pr merge 164 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch` (this repo lacks auto-merge); state=MERGED on first
verify, mergedBy=kriscendobot. Local + remote
`design/trust-on-first-bind` branch deleted;
`/home/kris/endo-wt/trust-on-first-bind-design` worktree removed; no
safety tags existed.

No known downstream PRs were waiting on PR 164. Per the design's
"Composes with PR #144" note, future implementation issues for the
`policyMode` constructor parameter on `HttpController` and the
`endo http policy` subcommand surface remain TODO; both are
documented in the design body's Test Plan as follow-on work to file
once the design is accepted.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 146)

PR 146 merged → `438d30809ad95ae22b6ed64043ad34d738c013e5` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T06:42:02Z.
`fix(fae): bind provider via storeIdentifier in setup scripts`,
contributor bug-fix PR from `0xpatrickdev` (cross-repo fork) addressing
a `storeLocator requires an endo:// locator` error during
`yarn setup-factory` in `packages/fae`.
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 2026-05-10T06:40:15Z, empty body),
MERGEABLE, 32 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 1 ahead, 28/28 CI SUCCESS at head
`e4beebf371`.
Cross-repo fork; no rebase performed (no push rights to fork, and GitHub
reported MERGEABLE with green CI on the head SHA). `git merge-tree` dry
run showed no conflicts; integration with current base is clean.
Single-commit PR with authoritative title and body (real bug-fix
description with the captp error trace, not process narrative); merge
commit message now uses PR_TITLE/PR_BODY per the 2026-05-10 repo
settings change.
Direct `gh pr merge 146 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch` (this repo lacks auto-merge); state=MERGED on first
verify. Remote branch `fix-fae-bind-provider-store-identifier` on the
contributor's fork deleted via `--delete-branch`; no local branch
existed; `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-146` worktree force-removed (carried
stale `packages/fae/tmp/` test-fixture deletes, no real working changes).
No known downstream PRs were waiting on PR 146.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 103)

PR 103 merged → `98c581315946eb0a0d429812d1147b29a94b7914` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T06:12:32Z.
`design(chat): slot-and-slash commands`, docs-only design (re-opened
from #30).
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 2026-05-10T06:11:22Z, empty body),
MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 0 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 26/26 CI SUCCESS at head
`f3bf100cec`.
No tidy needed (clean docs-only PR); skipped rebase (0 behind).
Direct `gh pr merge 103 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch` (this repo lacks auto-merge); state=MERGED on first
verify, mergedBy=kriscendobot.
Local + remote `design/chat-slot-slash-commands-bot` branch deleted;
`/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-103` worktree removed.

No known downstream PRs were waiting on PR 103. The sibling
`~/endo-wt/chat-slot-slash-commands` worktree (branch
`design/chat-slot-slash-commands` without the `-bot` suffix) is a
separate older-style local branch and was not touched by this merge;
left for the steward to triage if relevant.

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 161)

PR 161 merged → `72b7d2771052a6938175a2b7a2bc92676c92e9e6` (merge commit
to `llm`) at 2026-05-10T06:09:48Z.
`feat(zip): Support deflate compression (bring your own)`,
mirror of upstream endojs/endo#2997.
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 2026-05-10T06:08:21Z), MERGEABLE/CLEAN,
0 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 3 ahead, 28/28 CI SUCCESS at head
`7ad3687437`.
Three commits at entry read coherently as a stack of distinct concerns:
`feat(zip): Support deflate compression (bring your own)` (the upstream
work), `chore(zip): adapt to llm tip after rebase` (TS6 BlobPart casts +
"ZIP file" diagnostic regex update for llm-tip differences), and
`test(compartment-mapper,check-bundle): narrow files.get() result with
node:assert` (purely structural typedef fix for the tightened
`Map<string, ArchivedFile>`). Each documents a distinct adaptation;
kept discrete per "when in doubt, keep discrete". Skipped tidy and
skipped rebase (0 behind).
Direct `gh pr merge 161 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge
--delete-branch` (this repo lacks auto-merge); state=MERGED on first
verify. Local + remote `mirror/endo-2997-zip-deflate` branch deleted;
`/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-161` worktree removed.

**Downstream-unblocker note (steward to consider next cycle)**: PR
160 (`feat(exo-zip): in-memory ZIP as exo readable-tree`) cited PR
161 as an unblocker in a kriscendobot comment. PR 160 is OPEN against
`llm`, mergeable=UNKNOWN at the moment of this entry (GitHub
recomputing post-merge); a weaver may be appropriate if 160 is now
behind. Conductor did not self-dispatch (Agent tool not in this run's
surface, and per the recently-updated conductor.md downstream
follow-ups belong to the steward).

## Cycle 2026-05-10 (conductor PR 167)

PR 167 merged → `2755cd23df43fa05226af501a3b044c1b2318e6c` (merge commit
to `llm`).
`fix(ocapn,ocapn-noise): typed-array casts for @types/node v25`,
unblocker for the `@types/node` v25 family of breakage.
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 2026-05-10T01:39:27Z), MERGEABLE/CLEAN,
0 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 3 ahead, 29/29 CI SUCCESS.
Three discrete commits, each touching one file in a distinct package
(`packages/ocapn/src/netlayers/tcp-test-only.js`,
`packages/ocapn-noise/src/wasm/node.js`,
`packages/daemon/src/daemon-node-powers.js`); no fix-up follow-ups
to absorb, history reads coherently as-is. Skipped tidy and skipped
rebase (0 behind).
Direct `gh pr merge 167 --repo endojs/endo-but-for-bots --merge`
(this repo lacks auto-merge); state=MERGED on first verify.
Local + remote `fix/tcp-test-only-buffer-type` branch deleted;
`/home/kris/endo-wt/fix-tcp-test-only` worktree removed.

**Follow-up needed (steward to dispatch)**: PRs 142 and 161 were
blocked on PR 167's @types/node v25 casts per kriskowal's
shepherd-until-green directive at 2026-05-09T23:48Z and the bot's
reply at 2026-05-10T00:21Z. Both need a **weaver** to rebase onto
fresh `llm` (now containing #167's commits), then a **shepherd** to
confirm CI converges green.
Conductor could not self-dispatch the sub-agents (the harness in
this run did not expose the Agent tool).
Briefs:
- PR 142 (`feat(bytes): @endo/bytes package`): worktree
  `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-142`, branch `feat/endo-bytes` at
  `4750ee9169`.
- PR 161 (`feat(zip): Support deflate compression`): worktree
  `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-161`, branch `mirror/endo-2997-zip-deflate`
  at `f8bacc903f`. **Resolved 2026-05-10T06:09:48Z**: PR 161 merged
  this cycle (see entry above) after weaver+shepherd cycle landed
  the test-narrowing fix.

## Cycle 2026-05-08 (conductor PR 136)

PR 136 merged → `9573569c48226a74926fee050b25fe24f777f1f0` (merge commit
to `llm`).
`design(sandbox): mirror PLAN/endo_posix_sandbox.md into designs/`,
designer-authored mirror for milestone calibration.
At survey: APPROVED (kriskowal 01:18 with two minor cleanup comments),
isDraft=true, MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE, reviewDecision=APPROVED.
Addressed both review comments on `designs/endo-posix-sandbox.md`:
removed kriskowal from the Author field (replaced with `kriscendobot
(prompted by kriskowal)`); fixed phase-progression table column
alignment by hand (Prettier with default config does not auto-align
markdown table cells, but the column widths now match throughout).
Force-pushed `08bf2a5e8e` with `--force-with-lease`.
Replied to both review comments (3205638470, 3205640040) with `Done.
<sha>` confirmations.
Marked PR ready for review (was draft); `gh pr merge --auto --merge
--delete-branch` resolved as direct merge immediately (branch
protection does not gate on CI).
state=MERGED on first verify.
Local `design/sandbox-roadmap` branch deleted; `design-sandbox-roadmap`
worktree removed.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 (conductor PR 137)

PR 137 merged → `6a5aecd01d133e807b2666102a6450ea12487d29` (consolidation
of OCapN noise stack #111+#112+#113); source PRs #111/#112/#113 left
open per kriskowal's reopen at 23:57 (history/discussion). At survey:
APPROVED (kriskowal), MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE (CI propagating: 18/29
SUCCESS, 11 pending, 0 fail), 0 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 4 ahead. Four
commits read coherently (`feat(ocapn): codec injection +
network/transport split`, `feat(ocapn-noise): Noise IK netlayer with
browser portability`, `test(ocapn-noise): integration, transports,
fabrics`, `chore: update yarn.lock for ocapn + ocapn-noise` — the
lockfile per yarn-lock-separate-commit convention). Skipped tidy and
skipped rebase (0 behind). Issued `gh pr merge --auto --merge
--delete-branch`; GitHub resolved as direct merge immediately (branch
protection does not gate on CI). state=MERGED on first verify. Local
`feat/ocapn-noise` branch in `~/endo.repo` deleted; worktrees
`~/endo-wt/feat-ocapn-noise` and `~/endo-wt/conductor-pr137` removed.
Source PRs #111/#112/#113 NOT closed — the maintainer's reopen at
23:57 overrode the bot's prior close, signalling intent to keep them
open for history/discussion.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 (conductor PR 119)

Merged this run:

- #119 → `42a452928dfea2938f18e2ff0fb79375fe5d325d` (merge commit
  to `llm`). `feat(sandbox): provide default $PATH derived from
  rootfs`, original author jcorbin. At survey: APPROVED (kriscendobot
  21:11), MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 27/27 CI SUCCESS at brief, 3 behind
  `bots-ssh/llm`, 3 ahead. Three commits at entry read coherently:
  `feat(sandbox): provide a fallback $PATH semantics`,
  `chore(sandbox): fix dead TODO/ vs TADA/ citation paths`
  (shepherd's citation fix), and `fix(sandbox): mounted bin paths
  have predictable dependencies` (jcorbin's iterative refinement
  with new TADA/25 design doc). Skipped tidy — discrete commits
  document discrete concerns. Rebased onto `bots-ssh/llm` cleanly
  (no conflicts), force-pushed `ac19b79d59` with `--force-with-lease`.
  Per role guidance, rebase moots brief's "direct `--merge`" claim;
  used `--auto --merge --delete-branch`. GitHub resolved as direct
  merge immediately (branch protection does not gate on CI).
  state=MERGED on first verify. Local `shepherd/pr-119` branch
  deleted; `shepherd-119` worktree removed.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 (conductor PR 99)

Merged this run:

- #99 → `eefbff0b2ad185ef07a9a59a7480f444a13eee04` (merge commit
  to `llm`). `feat(daemon): garbage-collect content store and
  scratch-mount dirs` + adversarial test coverage. At survey:
  APPROVED, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 19 behind `bots-ssh/llm`, 3 ahead.
  Rebased onto `bots-ssh/llm` cleanly (no conflicts). Three
  commits at entry: `feat(daemon)`, `test(daemon)`,
  `fix(daemon): mark transitive hashes retained ... (#99 review)`.
  The third was a review-followup that addressed a defect in the
  feat commit (transitive tree-hash sweep), so reordered it to
  position 2 and absorbed via `fixup`. Tree byte-identical
  against pre-tidy `1f425236d1` (empty `git diff`). Reworded the
  feat commit message to drop the "out of scope, tracked as a
  follow-up" caveat and instead document the
  `collectTransitiveTreeHashes` helper that the absorbed fix
  introduced. Force-pushed `8c0d7d8493` with
  `--force-with-lease`. Issued `gh pr merge --auto --merge
  --delete-branch`; GitHub processed it as a direct merge
  immediately (branch protection does not gate on CI). state=MERGED
  on first verify. Local + remote `feat/daemon-content-store-gc`
  branch deleted; `pr-99` worktree removed.

Many vacuous cycles between 08:00 and 14:30 UTC — both liaison + marshal returned `no state change since prior` each fire; no contributor activity, no merges, no maintainer feedback. Estate steady.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 14:55 UTC

- **PR 119** (`feat(sandbox): provide default $PATH derived from
  rootfs`, jcorbin, +1598/-17, 11 files) opened at 14:53 UTC.
  First non-bot, non-maintainer activity in 7 hours. Touches
  `packages/sandbox/` — same package the daemon-os-sandbox-plugin
  reclassification surfaced.
- **Panel review** posted as `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (review
  `pullrequestreview-4245100904`): 10 approve/comment-only, 2
  request-changes. Must-fix:
  1. Empty PR body for a 1.6 kLOC cross-cutting change spanning
     11 files and 3 TADA design docs. Add summary cross-linking
     `TADA/21..23`.
  2. Six dead doc citations: source code references
     `TODO/22_sandbox_bwrap_path_refinements.md` and
     `TODO/23_sandbox_podman_path.md`, but those files actually
     live in `TADA/`. Sites: `src/drivers/path.js` (lines 13, 14,
     217), `src/drivers/bwrap.js` (line 335),
     `test/bwrap.test.js` (line 906),
     `test/podman.test.js` (line 660).
- **Saboteur findings** posted as PR comment
  (`issuecomment-4398264566`): 4 concrete fix targets across 7
  attack vectors:
  1. `realpath` survivors in `filterAmbientPathForHostBind`
     (symlink farm bypasses the `/tmp` blocklist).
  2. Reject `:` / control chars in `joinPathEntries`
     (delimiter injection via `mount.innerPath`).
  3. Early-return `[]` in `probeMountRootfsBinPaths` when
     `hostPath` is non-absolute.
  4. Document or change empty-probe `mount`-rootfs fallback
     (currently falls back to host-shaped DEFAULT_PATH that
     doesn't exist in the slice).
- **Hand-off**: PR is a contributor PR (jcorbin), so the bot does
  NOT auto-dispatch a fixer. Findings surfaced to jcorbin +
  kriskowal via the review + comment. If jcorbin doesn't address
  before merge, the maintainer can request a bot fixer dispatch
  via the steward.
- **Saboteur self-improvement**: new skill
  `skills/saboteur-adversarial-review.md` (commit `6c0665ee23`)
  captures the rootfs-derived environment derivation attack class
  for future reuse on `drivers/path.js`-shaped code.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 07:30 UTC

PR 115 merged via conductor → `12e8600e8c`. Liaison surfaced new
issue #118 (OCapN/Daemon integration). Marshal vacuous (awaiting
your reclassification of `daemon-os-sandbox-plugin`). Groom
reconciled post-merge state (`bbc7448951`).

Merged this cycle (2026-05-07 conductor, PR 115 cycle):

- #115 → `12e8600e8c3315ab4d797d4fe1766e0fb178b861` (merge commit
  to llm). `design(daemon): filesystem watchers (closes #110)`.
  At survey: APPROVED, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, 0 behind `bots-ssh/llm`,
  3 ahead. Three commits: the original design doc plus two
  follow-up tweaks (fold-in of maintainer answers, then
  `entry`→`type` rename) — both clear fixups against the doc
  introduced in the first commit. Interactive-rebase absorbed
  both as `fixup` into the base commit; tree byte-identical
  (empty `git diff` against pre-tidy `cd4a9d1bc6`). Force-pushed
  `b952c8bb54` with `--force-with-lease`. Issued `--auto --merge
  --delete-branch`; GitHub processed it as a direct merge
  immediately (branch protection here does not gate on CI).
  state=MERGED on first verify. Local + remote
  `design/filesystem-watchers` branch deleted; `pr-115`
  worktree removed. Next-up PR 114 has CI green; awaiting
  kriskowal approval before queueing.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 07:00 UTC

- **PR 115** approved by kriskowal at 06:38 UTC (review
  `pullrequestreview-4241651383`). Add to merge queue once a
  conductor cycle is dispatched.
- **PR 114** fixer landed: master synced (bots-ssh/master moved
  from `4cb1ed4d26` to `f37c4b2d8f`, preserving 2 design-doc
  commits on top of `actual/master`); PR 114 rebased onto the
  new master; HEAD now `482ad077dc` (was `a8f1243f3b`); panel +
  saboteur fixes folded; saboteur tests added; CI in flight at
  cycle close (10 SUCCESS, 16 PENDING; mergeStateStatus=UNSTABLE
  pending CI). Re-requested review from kriskowal.
- **PR 111** received an 8-comment review batch from kriskowal
  06:39-06:53 UTC. Reactji'd 👀 on all 8. Note: a transient
  GitHub indexing anomaly hid these comments from the PR's
  review-thread API endpoint; comment bodies were captured from
  the events API payload. Fixer landed: 5 fold-ins applied
  (changeset omit, captp Slot type restore, `@endo/hex` adoption,
  drop deprecated `diagnosticEquals` shim, drop ava-duplicative
  `equals` helper + empty-file removal); 1 stalled with reply
  (cancelled-Promise<never> threading needs maintainer guidance);
  2 architectural-only replies (passable-CBOR extraction,
  sturdyreftracker vs noncelocator). HEAD `0116aa1283` (was
  `459d52c4aa`). 556 tests passed, lint clean. Re-requested
  review from kriskowal. Fold-in replies posted as one top-level
  summary (inline-reply API was 404'ing for these comments per
  the GitHub indexing anomaly). **Stack follow-up**: PRs 112 and
  113 stacked on 111; expect CONFLICTING/DIRTY after force-push;
  restage as separate steward concern.
- **Liaison cycle landed** (after this dispatch state was first
  written): issue #98 was closed upstream, tracking file deleted.
  Issue #116 (`Frugal use of CI`, kriskowal 04:55 UTC) opened;
  reactji + reply posted, `process/tracking/116.md` created.
  **Surface to steward for next marshal cycle**: #116 needs a
  researcher dispatch to survey change-impact-aware test selection
  for a primarily-Node monorepo (turborepo affected-by, nx
  affected, lerna `--since`, GH Actions path filters), with
  smaller C/Go/Rust components; deliverable is a proposal, not an
  implementation. Maintainer disprefers Bazel-scale solutions if
  lighter approach suffices.

- **Marshal cycle landed**: maintainer removed the review-queue
  back-pressure threshold ("It is sufficient to cap concurrent
  builder projects"); marshal.md updated. With 0 builders in
  flight and 1 eligible design, marshal would now dispatch a
  builder against `daemon-os-sandbox-plugin` (M5 capability,
  516-line spec, external deps only).
- **Builder dispatched**: `daemon-os-sandbox-plugin` — STALLED
  at pre-flight. The design's `Status: Not Started` is stale:
  `bots-ssh/llm` ships `packages/sandbox/` (Phase 0/1/1.5/2 done:
  bwrap + podman drivers, scratch mounts, network profiles,
  Landlock probe, seccomp, prlimit caps) under a substantially
  richer interface (`SandboxFactory.make(opts).spawn(args) →
  ProcessHandle`) than the design specifies (`SandboxMaker
  .describe(endowments).run(cmd, args) → {stdout, stderr,
  exitCode}`). The builder added a pre-flight rule to
  `roles/builder.md` ("Not Started but actually shipped under
  different name is impasse, not greenfield") and surfaced for
  reclassification. **Surface for maintainer**: pick one of three
  paths:
  1. Revise the design to describe the shipped `@endo/sandbox`
     shape (mounts as remotables, network profiles by name,
     ProcessHandle with reader/writer streams) → bumps to
     `Status: Complete`.
  2. Supersede with a new design that layers on `@endo/sandbox`
     (e.g. a thin `Sandbox.run(cmd, args) → {stdout, stderr,
     exitCode}` convenience wrapper).
  3. Mark obsolete if `@endo/sandbox` is the canonical answer.
  In-flight design-builder count remains 0 / ceiling 3 (no
  builder dispatched). Marshal's eligibility list now empty
  pending the reclassification.

- **Master sync** moved bots-ssh/master to incorporate ~5 commits
  of actual/master drift; affects all PRs based on master (75,
  73, 74, 71, 69, 68, 67, 64, 60, 59, 57, 55, 54, 76, 114).
  Most are now N commits behind their new base; rebases will be
  triggered as those PRs progress.

## Cycle 2026-05-07 06:30 UTC

Discovery: scan-fresh-feedback surfaced an 11-comment review batch
from kriskowal on PR 115 (1 inline) and PR 117 (10 inline + review
summary), 06:00-06:17 UTC. All comments reactji'd 👀; both
designer dispatches landed in the same cycle:

- **PR 115** (`design/filesystem-watchers`): renamed
  `entry: 'file' | 'directory'` discriminator to `type`
  (alias `MountEntryType`); HEAD `cd4a9d1bc6` (was `2244e30c9b`);
  re-requested review from kriskowal.
- **PR 117** (`design/namehub-interface-unification`): adopted
  `ReadableNameHubInterface` as the unified abstraction;
  established `maybeLookup` as the primitive with `lookup`
  derived; narrowed mount surface (no locator methods, no
  formula-implying methods); converted Open Questions to
  Decisions; flagged future `link(namePath, resultName)` design.
  HEAD `1bebbaa383` (was `610b907d6f`); re-requested review from
  kriskowal.

Designer self-improvement landed on garden as `2c655756d5`:
"convert open questions to decisions on settled review".


Surveyed 30 open PRs on `endojs/endo-but-for-bots`. Down from 59 at
the prior snapshot; 29 PRs closed or merged across the session
(11 merged via the conductor, 18 closed-as-superseded by the
re-open-under-bot pattern: PRs 30, 44, 48 → 103, 101, 100; plus
mass cleanup of older review/* dependabot bots PRs). PRs 108 and
100 merged via the conductor at 2026-05-06 15:30 UTC.

### Counts

- `awaiting maintainer review`: 22 (the action queue; #100 + #108 merged this cycle)
- `blocked (CONFLICT)`: 4 (#55, #54, #76 mirror, plus a few older review/*)
- `blocked (ancient dependabot)`: 9
- `meta`: 1 (#83)

Total: 28 open PRs (down from 30).

### Dispatched-but-active builders

None in flight. Marshal is in vacuous-satisfaction (review-queue
depth=14 in the bot-managed subset; deferring sandbox-plugin
builder until queue draws down). See `roles/marshal.md` for the
trigger.

### Merge queue

(empty)

### Stalled list

(empty by current cycle's standard; see "Per-PR notes" below for
session history)

### Closed (no further tracking)

Per CLAUDE.md's "Closed PRs and issues are inert" rule, the
following closed-not-merged PRs receive no further dispatch,
follow-up, or tracking. The steward does not re-survey them and
will not dispatch any role against them. Discoveries that would
have warranted action go to a fresh follow-up artifact (a new PR
against the same code area, a new issue citing the closed one,
or a steward cycle-log note for the user).

Closed during this session (2026-05-06):

- #30 (`docs(designs): add chat-slot-slash-commands design`) closed 06:33 UTC, superseded by #103.
- #44 (`feat(chat): voice input via Web Speech API`) closed 05:55 UTC, superseded by #101.
- #48 (`docs: design loop scaffolding and unified-weblet-server revisions`) closed 05:44 UTC, superseded by #100.
- #56 (`feat(marshal): admit immutable ArrayBuffer through codecs`) closed 05:33 UTC, withdrawn by maintainer.
- #62 (`feat(random): add @endo/random ChaCha20-based seedable PRNG`) closed 05:32 UTC, superseded by the @endo/random + chacha12 split in #75.
- #70 (`feat(compartment-mapper): diagnose package.json without a name`) closed 04:15 UTC by maintainer; the auxiliary-package.json design lives at #96 instead.

Closed earlier (per session-history snapshot):

- #87 (`docs(bundle-source): drop NEWS.md recommendation`) closed 2026-05-05.
- #72 (`fix(bundle-source): include cacheSourceMaps in options type`) closed 2026-05-05.
- #52 (`feat(xorshift): add @endo/xorshift package`) closed 2026-05-06.
- #27 (`feat(base64): dispatch to native Uint8Array base64 intrinsic`) closed 2026-05-05.
- #24 (`chore: bump the all-minor-patch group`) closed 2026-05-02.
- #53, #77, #25, #63, #65, #66, #28, #61, #18 closed pre-session per the GraphQL audit; treat all of these as inert.

If a user direction explicitly references a closed PR by number,
verify state before dispatching: `gh pr view <N> --json state`
must return `OPEN`. A `CLOSED` or `MERGED` state means stop and
report; do not dispatch a sub-agent against it.

## Per-PR notes

### #50 (weaver complete, 2026-05-04)
Rebased to `921067c115` on top of current `bots/llm`; pushed with
`--force-with-lease`.
CI propagating (8 SUCCESS, 18 pending, 0 fail).
PR #58's base auto-updated to `921067c115` as expected.
Next cycle: confirm #50 lands; then rebase #58 if its base needs to
shift to `llm` directly post-merge.

### #70 (fixer complete, 2026-05-04)
Reviewer raised an unhandled case (entry deep in a typemod-scoped
sub-folder of an unnamed package).
Fixer reproduced it, determined the fix would change `mapNodeModules`
"compartment root" semantics (a design decision), and took the
deferral path the reviewer explicitly offered ("If we do not handle
that case yet, please reply to that effect instead").
Rebased onto current `master` (clean), pushed `2a382a832f`, posted
reply with reproducer + design analysis + offer to follow up.
Next cycle: skip unless review state changes.

### #81 (shepherd complete, 2026-05-04)
Pushed `chore: yarn format after prettier minor bump` (8 files,
formatting-only) → unmasked a SECOND lint failure: `typescript-eslint`
8.59 deprecated `parserOptions.project` when `projectService` is set.
This is an in-tree config change in `packages/eslint-plugin`, out of
shepherd scope. Posted comment.
Recurring-pattern note added to `roles/shepherd.md`.
Needs builder/fixer dispatch (or maintainer call) to update the
ESLint internal config.

### #82 (no dispatch, 2026-05-04)
Head `86e8b9b0e9` at 20:01 UTC supersedes the CHANGES_REQUESTED review at 19:02 UTC.
Maintainer re-review needed.
Next cycle: skip unless review state changes.

### #68 (no dispatch, 2026-05-04)
Head `cb8d6286ab` at 01:51 UTC supersedes the CHANGES_REQUESTED review at 01:44 UTC.
Awaiting re-review.

### #64 (no dispatch, 2026-05-04)
Head `d483637871` at 02:29 UTC supersedes the CHANGES_REQUESTED review at 02:18 UTC.
Awaiting re-review.

### #58 (no dispatch, 2026-05-04)
Stacked on `design/error-tracing-across-workers` (PR #50).
After PR #50's weaver-rebase lands, #58 will become stale-on-base relative to the new design tip and need a follow-up rebase.

### #56 (no dispatch, 2026-05-04)
Stacked on `design/endo-xorshift` (PR #52).
PR #52 has CONFLICT with `master`; #56 is blocked behind that.

### Review/* cluster (#33–#48, #46, #40, #37, #35)
Sixteen `review/*` PRs all 235 commits behind `llm`.
Five have CI failures alongside the staleness.
Mass-rebasing this cluster in one cycle would create force-push churn for the maintainer; defer to a coordinated weaver pass after the active cluster (#50, #58, #82) settles.

### Ancient dependabot cluster (#1–#10)
Nine bot PRs each 866–901 commits behind `llm`.
The rebase distance exceeds the practical threshold; recommend `@dependabot recreate` on each rather than manual rebase.
The steward does not post the comments; that is a maintainer action.

## Merge queue

(empty)

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor, PR 51 cycle):

- #51 → `96222a06e5` (merge commit to llm).
  `docs: distill PR-review best practices into CLAUDE.md and
  CONTRIBUTING.md`. Was 228 behind, 1 ahead at survey;
  MERGEABLE/CLEAN with `reviewDecision=APPROVED` and 25/25 SUCCESS.
  Single commit (already coherent); no tidy. Rebased onto current
  `bots-ssh/llm` (clean, no conflicts; merge-tree probe reported
  clean before the rebase). Force-pushed `76a65b77df` with
  `--force-with-lease=design/best-practices-from-review:4b08c7de65`.
  Issued `gh pr merge --auto --merge`; GitHub processed it as a
  direct merge immediately on the freshly pushed CI. state=MERGED.
  Local + remote `design/best-practices-from-review` branch
  deleted; no `pr-51` worktree existed (predates the lifecycle).

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor, PR 92 cycle):

- #92 → `e398264405` (merge commit to llm).
  `feat(daemon): simplify guest eval per design (refs
  guest-eval-simplification)`. Was 6 behind, 3 ahead at survey;
  MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE with `reviewDecision=APPROVED`. Single CI
  failure on `test (20.x, macos-15)` was a known transient
  (`1 unhandled rejection` in `ws-relay` teardown, not in the
  daemon-guest-eval code path). The three commits were already
  coherent (drop dead artifacts → regression test → design PR ref);
  no tidy. Rebased onto current `bots-ssh/llm` (clean, line-number
  drift only in `designs/README.md`); force-pushed `2b787690c9`
  with `--force-with-lease`. Issued `gh pr merge --auto --merge`;
  GitHub processed it as a direct merge immediately on the freshly
  pushed (still QUEUED) CI. state=MERGED. The fresh push obviated
  the macOS flake re-run plan since CI restarted from scratch.

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor, PR 93 cycle):

- #93 → `31df9e3cf1` (merge commit to llm).
  Was 2 behind at survey, MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE with CI in flight (16
  pass, 10 pending). Three commits, atomic per concern (rename,
  alias+test, design status). Rebased onto current `bots-ssh/llm` (no
  conflicts); kept the three commits discrete (the `feat(cli)` alias
  introduces a new behavior plus its own test, distinct from the pure
  rename refactor; design-status is independent bookkeeping).
  Force-pushed `3a3f0a7560` with `--force-with-lease`. Issued
  `--auto --merge`; GitHub processed it as a direct merge because CI
  converged in the interim. state=MERGED.

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor, resume cycle):

- #84 → merged (merge commit to master).
  Prior conductor tidied; resume conductor found CI conclusively green
  (26 SUCCESS, MERGEABLE) and ran direct `gh pr merge --merge`.
  state=MERGED.
- #88 → merged (merge commit to llm).
  Prior conductor tidied; resume conductor sampled CI as 18 SUCCESS + 8
  pending and issued `--auto --merge`.
  Pending checks completed in the interim, so GitHub processed the
  auto-merge as a direct merge; state=MERGED on first verify.

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor):

- #91 → `e3c1ef10b4` (merge commit to llm).
  Single-commit PR (`design(chat): Playwright build-and-load smoke
  in browser CI`); 0 behind, 26/26 SUCCESS at survey, MERGEABLE.
  Direct `gh pr merge --merge` succeeded; state=MERGED.
  No tidy required.

Merged this run (2026-05-05 conductor, second cycle):

- #90 → `49bb6b2a6d` (merge commit to llm).
  Roadmap reconciliation PR from groom; was 0 behind, 1 ahead at
  enqueue with 26/0/0 green CI and CLEAN mergeStateStatus. Single
  commit (`docs(designs): roadmap reconciliation 2026-05-05`) so
  no tidy needed. Direct `--merge` succeeded; state=MERGED.

Merged this run (2026-05-05 conductor):

- #86 → `d72fdc9527` (merge commit to llm).
  Prior conductor tidied + pushed `e9a2d712db` (two clean commits,
  byte-identical to pre-tidy). At dispatch time, attempting
  `gh pr merge 86 --auto --merge` discovered the PR was already
  MERGED: CI completed and the auto-merge fired in the window
  between the prior conductor's push and this dispatch.
  No action required beyond the bookkeeping update.

Merged this run (2026-05-04 conductor):

- #81 → `dac84e9de8` (rebase merge to llm).
  Was 7 behind at enqueue; gh auto-merge with `--rebase` rebased and
  merged on green CI immediately (mergeStateStatus=CLEAN, 26/26 SUCCESS).
- #85 → `8ddfab0d9d` (rebase merge to llm).
  Was 11 behind after PR 81 landed; brief snapshot showed 5 pending CI
  jobs but they completed in the interim. gh auto-merge with `--rebase`
  rebased and merged immediately. The 6 design-rename commits land as
  separate commits on llm under SHAs `9c8d9be2ae` through `8ddfab0d9d`.

Merged this run (2026-05-04 weaver continuous-merge):

- #50 → `741e8000fb` (rebase merge to llm).
  Clean: 0 behind, 26/26 SUCCESS at enqueue.
- #82 → `730f07810a` (rebase merge to llm).
  Required rebase from `86e8b9b0e9` to `1bb4d84b19` (2 behind after
  PR #50 merged); auto-merge with `--rebase` resolved on green CI.

Side effect for steward to handle next cycle:

- PR #58 (`feat/error-tracing-implementation`) targets
  `design/error-tracing-across-workers` (the branch behind PR #50).
  Post-merge state of #58 is `mergeable=CONFLICTING, DIRTY` because
  the underlying design content is now on llm via the rebase merge.
  PR #58 needs its base re-targeted to `llm` and a rebase to drop
  the design-doc commits already on llm.
  Surface to steward: dispatch a weaver (or builder) to re-base #58.

Merged this run (2026-05-06 conductor, PR 104 cycle):

- #104 → `ac5dd05663` (merge commit to llm).
  `fix(chat): re-import ses to install globalThis.assert without
  lockdown`. 9-line one-file fix that addresses the assert-global
  regression flagged by #94's smoke test (parallel to #95's fix
  for `harden`). At survey: APPROVED, MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE, 1 commit,
  1 behind `bots-ssh/llm` (clean). CI mostly green with two
  pre-existing macos-15 test flakes (`test (18.x, macos-15)` and
  `test (22.x, macos-15)`) unrelated to the patch. Per the brief's
  guidance that branch protection on this repo does not gate on CI,
  ran direct `gh pr merge --merge` without rebase. state=MERGED on
  first verify. Local + remote `fix/chat-import-ses` branch deleted;
  pr-104 worktree at `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-104` removed. Unblocks
  #94 (the chat bundle now ships with `assert` available at module
  load).

## Stalled list

Stalled this run (2026-05-06 conductor, PR 94 cycle):

- #94 (`feat(browser-test): chat build-and-load smoke`) →
  `ci needs builder/fixer`.
  Head `3a63392372` was already rebased onto current `bots-ssh/llm`
  (the prior pr-94 worktree did the rebase + the harden-fix
  validation by re-targeting onto #95 then back onto `llm` after
  #95 merged). MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE with `reviewDecision=APPROVED`
  but `browser-tests` (Playwright) FAILED with a NEW regression:
  `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: assert` at module load of
  `chat/assets/main-*.js`. Same shape as the harden regression
  that #95 fixed, but for a different missing global (`assert`
  rather than `harden`). The smoke test is doing its job —
  catching an unshimmed top-level `assert(...)` call in the chat
  bundle that breaks production-bundle execution. Out of conductor
  scope (the fix is in `packages/chat`, parallel to #95). Needs a
  follow-up fixer/builder to source `assert` from `@endo/errors`
  (or equivalent) in the chat modules that use it at top level.
  pr-94 worktree at `/home/kris/endo-wt/pr-94` left in place for
  the follow-up dispatch; remote branch
  `feat/chat-playwright-smoke` left intact.
