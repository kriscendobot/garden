## What is the Problem Being Solved?

OpenCode's `task` tool can spawn one subagent at a time and wait for it
to finish before the parent can do anything else. The
`background: true` flag (gated behind
`OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` at
[`packages/opencode/src/tool/task.ts`](../../external/opencode/packages/opencode/src/tool/task.ts)
line 113) lets the parent fire-and-forget, but the result must be
manually polled via `task_status` or arrives as a toast notification
when the background task completes. This is a single-process
constraint dressed up as a feature: OpenCode's agent runs in one
process with one event loop, and "concurrent subagents" really means
"context-switch between fibers".

Endo's structural model makes this trivial. Every guest is a vat:
its own SES compartment, its own message queue, its own worker
process when configured. A guest spawning a sibling guest is a
regular `formulateGuest` + `send` interaction. The runtime can have
10 guests in flight at once with no special flag.

The gap is **not** concurrency itself; it is the **UX surface** that
exposes the concurrency. Today, a user who spawns guest A and guest
B in Chat sees two adjacent spaces with no parent-child relationship,
no panel widget, no aggregation of replies. The OpenCode `task`
shape (one tool call from a parent, one folded result block in the
parent's transcript) is good UX even if its underlying mechanism is
single-threaded; Endo can offer the *same* UX while underneath
running the children truly in parallel.

## Design

### Concept: the "panel" guest pattern

A **panel** is a guest formula whose role is to coordinate `N`
sibling sub-guests, dispatch a prompt to each, await their replies,
and present the aggregated result to its parent. The panel is a new
guest *role* (its agent module shape), not a new formula type; from
the daemon's perspective it is an ordinary guest.

Vocabulary:
- **panel parent**: the guest that creates the panel.
- **panel**: the coordinator guest.
- **panel members**: the sibling sub-guests the panel dispatches to.
- **panel verdict**: the aggregated reply the panel returns to the parent.

The panel parent calls `E(panel).deliberate(prompt, options)`. The
panel formulates `N` member guests (or reuses pre-existing pet-named
ones), sends each the prompt as a `request` message, gathers each
member's reply, and resolves the deliberate-promise with the
aggregated verdict.

### Chat UX: the panel widget

In `packages/chat`, panel deliberations render as a single
collapsible block in the panel-parent's space:

```
┌─ Panel: 3 members deliberating ────────────────────────┐
│ ▾ assessor   ✓ done (2.3s, 412 tok)    [view reply]    │
│ ▾ stylist    ⠋ thinking…                                │
│ ▾ archivist  ✓ done (1.8s, 287 tok)    [view reply]    │
│                                                         │
│ Verdict: 2 of 3 agree on the approach; stylist pending │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each row links to the member's own space (which has its own inbox
and transcript, addressable independently); clicking "view reply"
expands the inline part. The widget updates in real time via the
existing Chat WebSocket subscription on the parent's inbox; the
parent receives one `value` message per member that resolves, plus
one final aggregated `value` when the panel concludes.

The OpenCode shape this borrows from: the `<task_result>` block in
[`task.ts`](../../external/opencode/packages/opencode/src/tool/task.ts)
lines 53 through 88 (`output()` and `backgroundMessage()` formatters)
collapses subagent output into a single block in the parent's
transcript. The Chat widget is the same shape, with the difference
that the underlying execution is genuinely concurrent.

### Daemon: the panel agent module

The panel is an agent module. Its `make(powers)` entry point
receives:
- `provideGuest`: to formulate panel members on demand.
- `inbox` / `submit`: standard guest plumbing for parent communication.
- `Timer`: for per-member deadlines ([endoclaw-timer](endoclaw-timer.md)).
- a `Lal` or `Fae` provider capability: to ask the LLM for an aggregation strategy (optional).

API (sketch):

```js
// @ts-check
import { makeExo } from '@endo/exo';
import { M } from '@endo/patterns';

export const make = ({ provideGuest, inbox, Timer }) =>
  makeExo(
    'Panel',
    M.interface('Panel', {
      deliberate: M.call(M.string()).optional(M.record()).returns(M.promise()),
    }),
    {
      async deliberate(prompt, options = {}) {
        const memberNames = options.members ?? ['assessor', 'stylist', 'archivist'];
        const deadline = options.deadlineMs ?? 60_000;
        const members = await Promise.all(
          memberNames.map((name) => E(provideGuest).provideGuest(name)),
        );
        const settled = await Promise.allSettled(
          members.map(async (member) => {
            const reply = await Promise.race([
              E(member).request(prompt),
              E(Timer).delay(deadline).then(() => { throw Error('panel-member-timeout'); }),
            ]);
            return reply;
          }),
        );
        return aggregate(settled);
      },
    },
  );

const aggregate = (settled) => harden({
  members: settled.length,
  agreed: settled.filter((s) => s.status === 'fulfilled').length,
  verdicts: settled.map((s) => s.status === 'fulfilled' ? s.value : { error: String(s.reason) }),
});
```

Each `E(member).request(prompt)` returns a promise that resolves when
the member's reply lands in the panel's inbox. Because each member
is its own guest (its own worker, its own SES compartment), the
`Promise.allSettled` over them is genuinely parallel; there is no
single event loop they share. This is the "falls out of Endo
trivially" the maintainer named.

### CLI surface

```
endo panel @code-review "review the diff in mount://workspace/wip"
endo panel @design-jury --members=critic,skeptic,copyeditor "design X"
```

The CLI subcommand creates a panel guest if one is not already
named, dispatches `deliberate`, and prints the verdict.

### Permission / capability story

The panel is a guest. To formulate member sub-guests, it needs a
`provideGuest` capability. The panel parent grants this when it
creates the panel; the parent retains the right to revoke (the
caretaker pattern from
[daemon-capability-filesystem](daemon-capability-filesystem.md)).
Members hold whatever capabilities the panel was authorized to
hand them; the panel cannot escalate.

The Endo *advantage* is that the permission story is
structural: a member that the panel did not endow with a `Shell`
cannot invoke a shell, period. OpenCode's
[`subagent-permissions.ts`](../../external/opencode/packages/opencode/src/agent/subagent-permissions.ts)
derives a stricter ruleset for the child; Endo derives a strictly
smaller capability set, which is the same idea expressed
structurally.

### Reuse: the panel as the judge's tool

The garden's `judge` role already runs a jury panel by dispatching
17 subordinate roles in sequence (per
`skills/pr-creation-flow/SKILL.md` § Jury composition). If the
garden's host daemon were Endo, the panel pattern would *be* the
judge: 17 panel members deliberate concurrently, the judge
aggregates. This is a strong validation of the shape.

## Phased Implementation

1. **Daemon-level panel agent module** (`packages/lal/panel.js` or a new `packages/panel/`): the `Panel` exo, the `deliberate` method, the per-member timeout, the aggregation function. ~200 LOC. **Size: S-M.**
2. **Chat UX widget**: a new message-part type `panel-deliberation` rendered as a collapsible block; per-member status pulled via `followMessages` on each member's inbox. ~400 LOC in `packages/chat`. **Size: M.**
3. **CLI subcommand**: `endo panel <pet-name> <prompt>`; one new file under `packages/cli/src/`. ~100 LOC. **Size: S.**
4. **Permission view in Chat** (deferred but listed): a panel widget that lets the parent see which capabilities each member holds and revoke individually. **Size: M.** Cross-references [daemon-retention-paths](daemon-retention-paths.md).

Total: 3 to 4 weeks for phases 1-3; phase 4 is independent.

## Open Questions

- **Member identity**: do panel members survive the panel? Default proposal: yes, members are durable guests addressable by pet-name; the panel is a coordinator, not an owner. Alternative: panel-scoped ephemeral members that get GC'd with the panel. The first is more useful for repeat deliberations; the second is more hygienic.
- **Aggregation strategy**: does the panel apply a tally / majority / LLM-aggregation, or simply hand back all member verdicts? Proposal: hand back all verdicts plus a default `agreed` count; the parent's agent module decides how to use them. Custom panels can override `aggregate()`.
- **Streaming**: do member verdicts stream into the parent's transcript as they land, or only after all members complete? Proposal: stream, with the widget rendering progress; the final aggregated `value` is a separate trailing message.
- **Concurrency bound**: is there a daemon-level cap on the number of concurrent panel members? Proposal: no hard cap; rely on the formula-store back-pressure (worker provisioning fails gracefully when out of slots). Document the practical cap based on observed worker memory.

## Design Decisions

1. **Panel is a guest, not a new formula type.** The 33 formula types
   ([`packages/daemon/src/formula-type.js`](../packages/daemon/src/formula-type.js)
   lines 6 through 35) already cover everything the panel needs.
   Adding a 34th would constrain the design to one shape; making the
   panel a *role* (agent module) lets variants like the design-jury
   panel and the code-review panel coexist without daemon-side
   plumbing.

2. **Aggregation lives in JS, not in the LLM.** The default aggregator
   counts agreement; LLM-based aggregation (asking the panel's own
   LLM to summarize the members' replies) is an opt-in option, not
   the default. Reason: deterministic aggregation is cheaper and
   debuggable; LLM aggregation can be added per-panel.

3. **Considered and rejected: panels-as-formula-type.** Reason: a
   formula type per role explodes the type registry; the guest-with-
   capabilities pattern is sufficient and consistent with how Lal
   and Fae are modeled today.
