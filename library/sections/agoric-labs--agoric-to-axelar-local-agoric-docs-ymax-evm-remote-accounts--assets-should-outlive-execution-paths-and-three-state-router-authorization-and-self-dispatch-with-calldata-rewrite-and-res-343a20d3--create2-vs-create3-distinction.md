> - the Remote Account implementation is deployed deterministically using permissionless CREATE2;
> - the Axelar router requires per-chain initialization data, such as the Axelar gateway address, so it is deployed deterministically using permissioned CREATE3;
> - the Remote Account factory currently uses the same initialization data on all chains. Some of that data, especially the initial multisig vetting authority, may differ on future chains, so the factory is also deployed using permissioned CREATE3.

§Three-named-deployment-modes with §named-rationale:

| Contract | Deployment | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remote Account implementation | Permissionless CREATE2 | No per-chain init data; address is purely a function of bytecode + salt |
| Axelar router | Permissioned CREATE3 | Per-chain init data (Axelar gateway address); CREATE3 decouples address from init data |
| Remote Account factory | Permissioned CREATE3 | Currently uniform init data, but future chains may differ (e.g., initial multisig); CREATE3 future-proofs |

§Compromise-of-deployment-key-doesn't-alter-deployed-contract-behavior. §It-can-only-interfere-with-the-goal-of-achieving-consistent-cross-chain-addresses.

§Borrowable-pattern: §CREATE2-vs-CREATE3-distinction for §deterministic-deployment with §named-per-chain-init-data-handling.
