  The implementation move behind the pending-region UI: change `executeWithSpinner` so the command bar is released immediately after dispatch, and let each pending card own its promise's settlement. This admits multiple concurrent commands. Names the user-intent ordering concern (rename-after-adopt) and explains why the pending region makes it visible.

Each dispatched command gets its own card. Commands are independent
daemon operations: the daemon already handles concurrent `E()` calls
correctly. The design names the relevant operations:

- `dismiss`, `adopt`, and `resolve` operate on different message
  numbers and do not interfere.
- `evaluate` runs in an isolated worker.

The daemon side is already concurrency-safe; the change here is purely
UI.
