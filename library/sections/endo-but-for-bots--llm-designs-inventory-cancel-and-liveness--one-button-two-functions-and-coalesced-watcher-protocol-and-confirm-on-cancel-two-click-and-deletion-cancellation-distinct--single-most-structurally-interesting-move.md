§One-button-two-functions (the cancel button IS the liveness indicator — single circular 12-14px element whose fill color shows incarnation state, click cancels) + §coalesced-liveness-watcher-protocol (single watcher with mutable watched-set replacing N+1 subscriptions) + §E.sendOnly-fire-and-forget-watch-unwatch (no round-trip latency on watch-set updates) + §confirm-on-cancel-via-two-click-3-second-timeout instead of modal dialog + §deletion-and-cancellation-are-distinct-operations (naming-operation vs lifecycle-operation).

§The-design-collapses-two-distinct-affordances-into-one (indicator + cancel button) while §preserving-a-third-distinct-affordance (remove button stays separate). §The-load-bearing-distinction: §deletion-removes-the-pet-name; §cancellation-terminates-the-incarnation; §pinned-capabilities-survive-name-deletion via PINS directory.
