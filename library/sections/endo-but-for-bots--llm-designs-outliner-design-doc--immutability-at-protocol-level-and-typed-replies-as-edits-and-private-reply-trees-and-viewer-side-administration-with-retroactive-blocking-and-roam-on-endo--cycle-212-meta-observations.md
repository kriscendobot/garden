§The-forty-sixth-consecutive-designs/chat-alternation-cycle 166-212.

§Papers-lane-blocked 106+ consecutive cycles (since cycle ~106).

§Library-reaches-717-sections at cycle 212.

§Type-3-chat-system as §a-named-third-instance is §a-new-pattern not previously named in the library. §Sibling-pattern to cycle 196 endoclaw's §thirteen-feature-categories which §enumerated-features-but-not-system-types.

§Three-cycles-sharing-the-no-upward-traversal-discipline now in library: cycle 161 daemon-capability-filesystem (§Bazel-style-selective-dependency-mounting), cycle 166 daemon-mount (§realpath-at-operation-time-confinement), cycle 212 outliner (§reference-scoping with the §file-system-principle). §Different-layers, same-discipline.

§Three-cycles-relying-on-the-same-SES-Compartment-substrate now in library: cycle 200 worker-rust-xs (§engine-level-confinement-via-XS-native-Compartment), cycle 205 evasive-transform (§SES-censorship-evasion), cycle 212 outliner (§custom-attenuation-code-in-SES-Compartment for §even-untrusted-attenuator-can-at-worst-interrupt).
