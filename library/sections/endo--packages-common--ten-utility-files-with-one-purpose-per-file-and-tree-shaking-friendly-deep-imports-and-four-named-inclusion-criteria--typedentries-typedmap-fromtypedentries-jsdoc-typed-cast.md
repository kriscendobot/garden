```js
export const typedEntries = /** @type {TypedEntries} */ (Object.entries);
export const fromTypedEntries = /** @type {FromTypedEntries} */ (Object.fromEntries);
export const typedMap = /** @type {TypedMap} */ (
  Function.prototype.call.bind(Array.prototype.map)

§Three-typed-casts for §JavaScript-built-ins that have §loose-default-types. §The-typed-versions preserve §the-narrower-generic-type that the built-in doesn't.

§The-typedMap is §uncurry-this on Array.prototype.map (sibling to cycle 199 trampoline's §classic-uncurry-this and cycle 207 env-options's §Reflect.apply-form). §Two-uncurry-this-shapes now seen plus this third (`Function.prototype.call.bind(...)`). §Three-canonical-uncurry-shapes in @endo.

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 209 path-compare's §JSDoc-callback-typedef-with-generic-T — both packages use §JSDoc-typedef as §typed-cast for §generic-type-narrowing.
