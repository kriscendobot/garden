  **Status: Not Started** upstream. Names two concrete chat-UX problems
  the indeterminate spinner causes (blocked input, no command history)
  and a third deeper *asymmetric record* problem (the inbox transcript
  shows inbound messages only; outbound commands are invisible).

The user is locked out of the command bar for the duration of the
operation. Fast operations (`dismiss`, `adopt`) resolve quickly. Slower
operations (evaluate, request, send) can take seconds or longer. While
the spinner is up:

- The user cannot type, issue a second command, or correct a mistake.
- The user cannot read back what they just submitted.
