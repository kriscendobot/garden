  The design's self-positioning. The pending region is a UI-only solution; a sibling design (`daemon-commands-as-messages`) proposes the deeper daemon-side fix that would model commands as self-addressed messages. The pending-region design names the relationship explicitly and frames itself as the near-term solution and as a fallback if the daemon change is deferred. Notable as a worked example of *near-term-UI vs. invasive-daemon-change* dependency framing in this design corpus.

| Design | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| [[endo-but-for-bots--llm-designs-chat-command-bar--command-bar-states-and-modeline]] | Command bar states and modeline that this design modifies (releasing the bar mid-flight is the modification) |
| `daemon-commands-as-messages` (not yet ingested) | Deeper daemon-level solution that would subsume the pending region |
