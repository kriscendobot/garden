> Processing of authenticated cross-chain messages in the router revolves around an important trick: a self-dispatch pattern. Instructions are encoded as calldata, and the target methods, while public on the router, verify that they were called by the router itself.

§The-target-methods-are-public-but-check-msg.sender-==-address(this). §This-creates-§two-benefits:

1. **§Error-catching-as-event-not-revert** — if a message is valid but execution fails, the router records the failure in the result event rather than reverting the entire transaction, §allowing-the-messaging-layer-to-mark-the-delivery-as-consumed-so-it-cannot-be-retried-later.
2. **§Block-explorer-readability** — because the dispatched instruction is encoded as normal EVM calldata, §it-makes-the-transaction-easier-to-inspect-in-block-explorers. The instruction can be decoded as a function call instead of appearing only as an opaque bytes payload.

§Borrowable-pattern: §self-dispatch-pattern with §msg.sender-==-address(this)-check for §two-named-benefits (error-isolation-via-event-not-revert + block-explorer-readability-via-decoded-function-call).

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 203 cache-map's §don't-establish-entry-until-prior-steps-succeed — both designs §isolate-failure-from-broader-state-changes.
