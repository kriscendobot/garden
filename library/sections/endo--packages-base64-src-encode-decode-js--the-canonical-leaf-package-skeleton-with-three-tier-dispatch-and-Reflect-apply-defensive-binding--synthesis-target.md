The §slot-machine-library's leaf utility packages (when
extracted from monolith) can §reuse-the-three-tier-dispatch
pattern if any of them have a native-platform-binding to
delegate to. §The-§polyfill-as-error-oracle-discipline applies
wherever a native intrinsic exists alongside a polyfill — the
polyfill knows what makes a good error message; the native
doesn't.
