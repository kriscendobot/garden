> Deposits are intents processed as a router instruction rather than as separate token transfers.

§Permit2-spender = router. §The-router's-EVM-address-can-represent-that-Ymax-instance when a user signs a Permit2 authorization.

§Factory-principal-check: §the-router-enforces-that-a-deposit-instruction-can-only-come-from-the-factory-principal (the Agoric Ymax contract instance associated with the factory).

§This-prevents §an-attacker-from-taking-a-permit-intended-for-the-Ymax-system-and-redirecting-funds-into-an-unrelated-Remote-Account. §The-factory's-deterministic-address-computation anchors §the-deposit-to-the-portfolio-account-designated-by-the-authenticated-Ymax-instruction.

§Borrowable-pattern: §permit-as-intent + §factory-principal-check for §authorization-routing where §the-permit-target-is-the-system-not-the-individual-account.
