> When no daemon is running, `endor run` creates a local CAS in a temp directory. This avoids coupling `endor run` to the daemon lifecycle while still enabling CAS deduplication and caching when the daemon is present.

§Two-modes:
- §Daemon-present: use daemon's CAS at `{statePath}/store-sha256` for cross-invocation deduplication.
- §Daemon-absent: temp-directory CAS for the single invocation; cleaned up after.

§The-design-doesn't-force-daemon-coupling. §`endor run` is §usable-standalone for §development-iteration and CI.

§Borrowable-pattern: §standalone-mode-when-no-daemon for §a-CLI-tool that can integrate with §an-optional-daemon. §The-CLI-doesn't-require-the-daemon but §benefits-from-it-when-present.

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 178 daemon-xs-worker-snapshot's §suspend-only-when-idle (graceful degradation when conditions aren't met), cycle 197 panic's §three-layer-dispatch-chain (graceful fallback through tiers).
