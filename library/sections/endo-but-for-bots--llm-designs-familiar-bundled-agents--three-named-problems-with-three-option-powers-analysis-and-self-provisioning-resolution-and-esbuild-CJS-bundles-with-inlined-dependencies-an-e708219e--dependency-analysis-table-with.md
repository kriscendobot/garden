| Package | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | Pure JS | HTTP client using `fetch` / `node:http` |

| `ollama` | Pure JS | HTTP client using `fetch` / `node:http` |

> **Conclusion: No binary dependencies need replacement.** The agents can be bundled as-is.

§Three-LLM-provider-SDKs-each-pure-JavaScript-HTTP-client. §The-explicit-conclusion-bolded-in-source removes §the-unspoken-question §"what-about-native-modules?" with §a-direct-answer.

§Borrowable-pattern: §Dependency-Analysis-table-with-named-conclusion for §packaging-or-bundling-designs that need to address §the-binary-dependency-question.

§The-bufferutil-and-utf-8-validate-aside is §honest-acknowledgement of §optional-WebSocket-dependencies already marked external; §they-are-not-a-factor for agent caplets.
