```js

  throw TypeError(
    'capacity must be a non-negative safe integer number <= 2**53 - 1',
  );
}
```

§Two-conditions-checked at construction: §safe-integer (cycle 199 @endo/nat's §safely-representable-IEEE-754-discipline) + §non-negative. §Single-TypeError-with-named-range.

§The-error-message-names-the-implicit-upper-bound (`<= 2**53 - 1`) — §greppable-for-callers-who-hit-it.

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 199 @endo/nat's §two-different-error-types (TypeError = wrong-kind; RangeError = right-kind-wrong-value). §Cycle-203-collapses-both into TypeError with §combined-message; cycle-199-distinguishes-them.
