Slot machine library §combo-comparator for §pay-table-priority:

- §Multi-tier-comparison-with-named-reasons borrowable for §combo-priority (e.g., higher-base-value-wins; tie → fewer-symbols-wins; tie → alphabetical).
- §Undefined-compares-greater-than-anything-else borrowable for §null-handling in §combo-arrays.
- §Building-block-and-derived-form borrowable for §exposing-low-level-and-high-level-comparators.
- §Mermaid-diagrams-with-worked-examples borrowable for §README-explanation-of-game-mechanics with §multi-tier-tie-breaking-rules.
- §JSDoc-callback-typedef-with-generic-T borrowable for §any-comparison-function-API.
