§Seven-freezes total. §Each-method-frozen-individually before composition; §the-implementation-object-frozen after; §the-kit-frozen after; §the-factory-frozen as the last line.

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 199 memoize's §harden-the-factory-and-the-products (memoize-the-factory + memoFn-the-product both hardened) — same discipline at finer granularity. §Cycle-203-uses-`freeze`-not-`harden` because it's a §pre-lockdown-utility (sibling to cycle 199 nat's §freeze-as-harden-substitute-pending-PR-#3008).
