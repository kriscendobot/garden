> Abstract: Pure re-export .d.ts indexes. Same shape as endo's types-index.d.ts convention.

## d.ts modules

We take on the complexity above of indirection because `.d.ts` files aren't checked. We have `"skipLibCheck": true"` in the root tsconfig.json because some libraries we depend on have their own type errors. (A massive one is the output of Telescope, used in `@agoric/cosmic-proto`.)

This means that the types you write in `.d.ts` file won't be checked by `tsc`. To gain some confidence, you can temporarily flip that setting in a package's own `tsconfig.json` and pay attention to only the relevant errors.
