1. **§esbuild Bundles** — add endo-lal.cjs and endo-fae.cjs entries; verify bundles build; test import in worker subprocess outside monorepo.
2. **§Resource Paths and Daemon Manager** — add endoLalPath/endoFaePath; pass ENDO_LAL_PATH/ENDO_FAE_PATH; add @lal/@fae special formulas to daemon-node.js (conditional on env vars).
3. **§Agent Self-Provisioning** — modify packages/lal/agent.js make() to detect @endo-level powers and self-provision; same for fae; overlaps with form-provisioning phase 2.
4. **§Auto-Incarnation** — add @lal/@fae lookup to daemon-node.js startup sequence; test end-to-end.

§Four-phases-with-named-test-criteria per phase. §Borrowable-pattern: §phased-implementation-with-named-overlap-with-sibling-design (Phase 3 explicitly notes overlap with form-provisioning Phase 2).
