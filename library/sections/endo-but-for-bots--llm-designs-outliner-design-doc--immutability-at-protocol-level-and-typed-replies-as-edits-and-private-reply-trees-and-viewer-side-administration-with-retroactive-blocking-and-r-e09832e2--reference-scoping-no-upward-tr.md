> Having a reference to a message does **not** grant reference to its parent. This follows the file-system principle: endowing a directory does not endow upward. Contained content is implied; non-contained content is not. You can give the bag and know that nothing but what's in the bag is getting handed over.

§The-file-system-principle: §endowing-a-directory-does-not-endow-upward. §Contained-content-is-implied; §non-contained-content-is-not.

§"You-can-give-the-bag-and-know-that-nothing-but-what's-in-the-bag-is-getting-handed-over" — §the-canonical-OCap-metaphor.

§Sibling-pattern to cycle 161 daemon-capability-filesystem's §absence-is-structural-not-policy and cycle 166 daemon-mount's §realpath-at-operation-time-confinement. §Three-designs sharing §the-no-upward-traversal discipline at §three-layers.

§Borrowable-pattern: §reference-scoping-no-upward-traversal as §the-canonical-OCap-discipline for §hierarchical-resource-sharing.
