Slot machine library §game-history-tree-with-branches:

- §Linked-chain-of-nodes-with-shared-prefix-stored-once borrowable for §game-history-tree where §multiple-game-branches-share-the-prefix (e.g., bonus-round-branching from the same base game).
- §Branching-is-free borrowable for §exploring-alternate-game-outcomes.
- §Assembly-via-walk-from-leaf-to-root borrowable for §replay-game-state-from-leaf.
- §Two-Phase Node Lifecycle borrowable for §game-state-where-inbound-events-and-own-state-updates-need-different-handling.
- §Honest-design-evolution-visible-in-the-prose borrowable for §game-design-documents-where-the-iteration-is-pedagogically-useful.
- §Pet-store-as-source-of-truth-with-in-memory-cache borrowable for §game-state-large-but-only-active-state-in-memory.
- §Text-prefix-as-out-of-band-metadata borrowable for §game-event-metadata-without-schema-changes.
