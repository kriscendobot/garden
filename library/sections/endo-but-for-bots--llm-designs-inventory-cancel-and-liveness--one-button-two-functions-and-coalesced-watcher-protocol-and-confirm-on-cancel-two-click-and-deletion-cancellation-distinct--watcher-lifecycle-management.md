> 1. On mount, create the watcher: `const watcher = await E(powers).makeIncarnationWatcher()`.
> 2. Start consuming `E(watcher).followTransitions()` in a background loop.
> 3. When an inventory item is rendered, call `E.sendOnly(watcher).watch(id)`.
> 4. When an inventory item is removed from the DOM, call `E.sendOnly(watcher).unwatch(id)`.
> 5. On unmount, the watcher's CapTP reference is dropped and the daemon garbage-collects it.

§Five-step-client-side-lifecycle. §Steps-3-4 are §E.sendOnly (fire-and-forget); §step-1 awaits the watcher creation (one round-trip per session, not per item).

§For-nested-inventories: §"the same watcher instance is shared. The nested inventory adds its items' identifiers to the same watched set." §Watcher-shared-across-the-component-tree.

§Borrowable-pattern: §single-watcher-per-component-tree + §per-item-watch/unwatch-fire-and-forget + §automatic-GC-on-unmount via CapTP reference drop.
