notes: The "structural refactoring, no security properties change" claim is the load-bearing safety story. Pre-1.0 status (`@endo/ocapn` v0.2.2) authorizes the breaking change without semver ceremony. The Syrup wire-format change in OcapnLocation field name is the only inter-implementation coordination cost — must talk to the OCapN spec group.

- This is a structural refactoring. No security properties change.
- The refactoring makes security boundaries clearer: the network is the trust boundary, not the transport.
- Each network is responsible for its own authentication guarantees. OCapN core should document what security properties it expects from a network (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, peer authentication).
