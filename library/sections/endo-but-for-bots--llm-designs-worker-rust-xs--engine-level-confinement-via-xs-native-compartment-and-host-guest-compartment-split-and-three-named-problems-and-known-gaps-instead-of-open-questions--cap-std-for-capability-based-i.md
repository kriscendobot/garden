> The Rust worker opens `Dir` handles at startup and provides them to JS as directory tokens. cap-std rejects path traversal and symlink escapes at the syscall level — the worker process itself is confined to its assigned directories, independent of any JS-level checks.

§cap-std-as-the-capability-substrate — the Rust library's `Dir` type holds an open file descriptor and uses `openat(2)` / `renameat(2)` etc. with the dir-fd as the base. §Path-traversal-and-symlink-escapes-rejected-at-the-syscall-level — §the-kernel-does-the-confinement.

§Independent-of-any-JS-level-checks — §defense-in-depth at the §kernel-level. §Sibling-pattern: cycle 166 daemon-mount's §realpath-at-operation-time-confinement (the JS-level analog), cycle 190 endo-posix-sandbox's §cap-not-string-mounts (the Rust process-level analog). §Three-different-layers of §capability-based-FS-confinement implemented at §three-different-levels.

§Borrowable-pattern: §cap-std-as-the-substrate when §the-syscall-level-confinement-is-acceptable. §Linux/macOS only at present (Windows analog via `cap-windows` named-future-work).
