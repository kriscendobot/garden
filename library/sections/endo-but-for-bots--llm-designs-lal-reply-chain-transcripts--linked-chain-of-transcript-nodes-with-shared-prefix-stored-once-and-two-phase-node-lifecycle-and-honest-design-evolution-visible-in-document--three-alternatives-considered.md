| Alternative | Rejection Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Full transcript copy per branch | Wasteful: long conversations with many branches duplicate the entire prefix |
| Single transcript with context tags | Fragile: LLM may confuse contexts; wastes context window |
| Depth as structured message field | Requires daemon schema changes; deferred (text prefix is sufficient initially) |
