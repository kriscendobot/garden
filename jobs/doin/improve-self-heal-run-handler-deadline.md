scripts/jobs/self-heal-run.sh
Wrap the handler invocation at line 104 (`"$@" > >(tee -a "$capture") 2>&1 &`) in a `timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=<grace> <bound>` the same way the responder already is at line 247-250, so a wedged handler is bounded well inside each unit's `TimeoutStartSec` instead of relying on systemd's blunt job-timeout + SIGKILL backstop. Add a new tunable (e.g. `SELF_HEAL_HANDLER_TIMEOUT`, defaulting comfortably below the tightest caller's `TimeoutStartSec`, e.g. 600s) and classify a resulting rc=124/137 the same way `is_nonattributable_rc`/the offline-signature grep already do, so a timed-out handler exits clean (no responder burn, no Failed unit) rather than looking like a crash. This directly explains today's incident: `garden-comment-watcher@endojs-endo-but-for-bots` and two `garden-receipt-watcher@*` instances each ran past the full 900s `TimeoutStartSec` during a ~30min degraded-connectivity episode and required forceful termination (one needed a cgroup SIGKILL after the 20s `TimeoutStopSec` grace expired), while every other watcher on the same host failed open within seconds via its own internal cursor/fetch bounds. Since self-heal-run.sh is the shared wrapper for the whole fleet, this single change protects every service that rides it, not just these two.
