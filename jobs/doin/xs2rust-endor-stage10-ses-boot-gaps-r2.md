# Stage-10 child 5/7 — SES worker-bundle boot on endor-vm, gap round 2

**Provenance:** continuation of child 4 (`xs2rust-endor-stage10-ses-boot-gaps-r1`). Read its
tada report (`journal/jobs/tada/xs2rust-endor-stage10-ses-boot-gaps-r1.md`) FIRST — it names
the exact halt signature where round 1 stopped and the gaps already closed. Resume from
precisely there; do not re-derive or re-do its work (sync to the real tip; its commits are
already on the branch).

## The work

Same iterative gap-closure discipline as round 1: drive `bus-worker-xs-ses-boot.js` into the
endor-vm compartment via the boot-bundle gate harness, close the first gap you hit
(transliterated from XS C, dual-run bit-exact or soundness-gated, curated cases, push), repeat
until the window nears.

**Success criterion for the round (not required, but the target):** the SES bundle boots to
completion — `lockdown()` runs, the CapTP machinery installs, `handleCommand` lands in the
persistent realm (child 3's surface). If the bundle boots, spend remaining window driving one
`deliver` through `handleCommand` end-to-end in a unit test and report how far it got — that
hands child 6 a running start. If it does not boot, report the next halt signature exactly as
round 1 did; the supervisor (s32) will size further rounds from your report.

## Standing discipline (binding, read fully)

**Repo:** `endojs/endo-but-for-bots`, PR **#600**, branch `xs2rust-endor` (base `llm`). **Keep the PR DRAFT; never comment on it.** Report via your tada completion report ONLY — never message the parked supervisor or the maintainer.

**Worktree:** `$HOME/scripts/jobs/ensure-project-worktree.sh <your-job-base> endojs/endo-but-for-bots xs2rust-endor`, then sync to the REAL remote tip (`git fetch origin xs2rust-endor && git checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD`) — the hourly press may have rebased the branch since this body was written (it did so on 2026-07-18: `cf45517211` → `8865953620`, rust/ byte-identical); never assume a sha, record the one you measured at.

**Environment (binding):** `cargo` at `$HOME/.cargo/bin`; the engine workspace is `rust/engine`, NOT the repo root (the daemon/worker code builds the ROOT workspace's `endor` bin). Before any acceptance-grade engine run: `cargo clean -p endor-compile -p endor-vm -p endor-oracle` (stale seeded `target/` false-passes AND false-fails; you MAY `cp -al` a same-commit sibling's `target/` to seed, but the three crates above must be cleaned after seeding). `c/moddable`: `rmdir` the empty dir, then `cp -al` from a same-pin sibling or shallow sha-fetch, `git -C c/moddable checkout --detach 23b4d6b0a65f35209d9118c4c13c6c9b3e68784d`, verify `git status` clean at the pin — **never `git add c/moddable`**. Capture cargo/test output to files and check `$?` (a pipe to `tail` masks the exit code). `/tmp` is noexec: use `TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp` (mkdir it first). The three environment-artifact classes behind mass failures: AF_UNIX `sun_path` overflow (socket tests need a REAL short path, e.g. under `~/tmp/`; symlinks do NOT work), provisioning-race uniform asserts (killed-mid-install; re-provision before believing), stale build caches (fresh-clean rule above). Prebuilt engine binaries are invoked WITHOUT `--` (e.g. `./target/debug/compile-diff language/<subtree>`; no-arg = the curated corpora + SYMB run); the module-corpora test is a LIB test (`cargo test -p endor-262 --lib module_corpora -- --nocapture`). Daemon `test:rust` runs select the Rust engine via `ENDO_WORKER_BIN='<abs>/endor worker -e rust'` — `ENDO_ENGINE=rust` does NOT route child-process workers (stage-9c child 9's measured correction).

**Sizing + push discipline (binding):** you have ONE 2400s handler invocation. Push each coherent item AS IT COMPLETES (`git push origin HEAD:xs2rust-endor`; verify by git EXIT CODE; concurrent pushes race at the CAS — fetch, rebase, retry), so a deadline poison loses only the in-flight item. If you cannot finish everything, land what is verified and report the remainder honestly in your tada — an honest, precisely-named remainder is a GOOD outcome, not a failure.

**Verification bar for engine changes:** engine-workspace `cargo test` EXIT=0 captured to a file (every `test result:` line 0 failed — 47 lines / 673 passed at stage-9 close); curated compile-diff all-identical + SYMB (report the count — **1878** at stage-9 close, may have grown); boot gate green (report the count — 17 at stage-9 close — and any skip→green conversions); **zero NEW Rust warnings**; `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` intact at every engine crate root (grep and report the count — 7 at stage-9 close; `endor-oracle` stays the audited FFI seam); `c/moddable` clean at the pin, never staged; no committed bundles. Any NEW VM side table must be ledgered the day it lands (GC-roots + snapshot contract — the pattern of `proxies` (Pending) and `DebuggerState` (SnapshotExcluded) in `endor-snapshot/src/sidetable.rs`). **DOCTRINE: accuracy-over-parity** — result agreement gates; computron-vs-oracle is advisory telemetry; never back-fit meters to oracle computrons or CESU-8 byte lengths.
