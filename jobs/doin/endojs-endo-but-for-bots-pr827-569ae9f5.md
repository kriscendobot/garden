## BEFORE you edit — run the recheck preflight (deterministic)

A peer may have already resolved this feedback. Run, from the garden root:

  scripts/jobs/gardening/pr-feedback-preflight.sh endojs/endo-but-for-bots 827 5047639672 kriskowal

It inspects the PR branch HEAD commits and inline replies for a peers
resolution citing this comment. Exit 2 = NO-OP (already resolved by a peer):
do NOT edit or push — complete the job as a clean no-op, noting the peer
resolution. Exit 0 = proceed with the work. (Any other exit fails open →
proceed; the push CAS is still the backstop.)
