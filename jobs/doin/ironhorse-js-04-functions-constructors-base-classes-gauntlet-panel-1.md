# Gauntlet stage: PANEL round 1 — endojs/endo-but-for-bots PR #970

You are ONE stage of a staged gauntlet (ironhorse-js-04-functions-constructors-base-classes-gauntlet). Run EXACTLY ONE panel round, post the
verdict, then STOP — do NOT fix, do NOT un-draft, do NOT loop.

1. Get an ISOLATED project checkout of the PR head:
   `/home/kris/garden2/scripts/jobs/ensure-project-worktree.sh ironhorse-js-04-functions-constructors-base-classes-gauntlet-panel-1 endojs/endo-but-for-bots <pr-head-branch>`.
2. Run the panel in SINGLE-ROUND mode against that worktree:
   `GARDEN_PANEL_SINGLE_ROUND=1 \
     /home/kris/garden2/scripts/jobs/gardening/panel.sh <worktree> 970 <base-ref>`
   It fans the seats, aggregates, and prints its disposition as the terminal line's
   last token: `pass` or `must-fix`. It does NOT fix or un-draft in this mode.
3. Post the aggregate (in $GARDEN_PANEL_RUNDIR) as a `gh pr review` on https://github.com/endojs/endo-but-for-bots/pull/970 — the
   panel-verdict shape the next-stage-owed heuristic recognizes (a request-changes
   review on must-fix, a comment/approve on pass).
4. If panel.sh could not decide (it exits non-zero), this stage FAILS: begin your
   report with `orchestration-failed: true` and do NOT emit a panel marker.

END your completion report with EXACTLY ONE of these marker lines (last line):
  <!-- gauntlet-stage-result: panel=pass -->
  <!-- gauntlet-stage-result: panel=must-fix -->

<!-- garden-reaped: 0 -->
