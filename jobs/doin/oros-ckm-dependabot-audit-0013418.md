Repo: kriscendobot/oros-ckm-data-readiness (bare clone worktrees/kriscendobot-oros-ckm-data-readiness.git), branch ckm-poc-build @ 0013418.
The "Close out demo-to-deck alignment arc" commit (0013418, amending CLAUDE.md § Demo-to-deck alignment) records a PROMOTED follow-up: "Dependabot investigate-only pass (2 high on public default branch; pre-existing, zero deps added this arc; complete before funder-room window)." This is a public (Apache 2.0) repo and the alerts predate this arc — investigate-only, no code change implied unless a safe fix is available.
Note: `gh api repos/kriscendobot/oros-ckm-data-readiness/dependabot/alerts` currently returns "Dependabot alerts are disabled for this repository" (403) — first confirm whether alerts are actually disabled (vs. a token-scope gap) via the repo's GitHub Security tab, then identify the 2 high-severity findings via `yarn audit`/`npm audit` against the default branch's lockfile if the Security tab is unreachable. Produce a short findings summary (package, severity, whether a non-breaking upgrade closes it) for the maintainer; do not merge into `main` — this repo's convention is milestone-merge only, and this is an investigate-only pass.
