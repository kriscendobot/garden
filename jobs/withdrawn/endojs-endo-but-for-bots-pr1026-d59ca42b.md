----- comment excerpt (untrusted, truncated) -----
CI is green except `test (24.x, ubuntu-latest)`, which failed on a **flaky teardown hang unrelated to this PR**: - The failure is in `@endo/cli`'s chat component suite — `Failed to exit when running test/component/formula-view-component.test.js` / `Exiting due to SIGINT`, after

## BEFORE you edit — run the recheck preflight (deterministic)

A peer may have already resolved this feedback. Run, from the garden root:

  scripts/jobs/gardening/pr-feedback-preflight.sh endojs/endo-but-for-bots 1026 5322728628 kumavis

It inspects the PR branch HEAD commits and inline replies for a peers
resolution correlated to this feedback. Exit 0 = proceed with the work.
(Any other exit fails open → proceed; the push CAS is still the backstop.)

Exit 2 is a HINT, not a licence to close. It proves only that correlated
text exists somewhere on the PR — never that THIS directive was satisfied.
Before you complete as a no-op you MUST corroborate, for EVERY ask in the
directive:
  * name the artifact that resolves it (commit SHA, reply id, PR/issue
    number, or job-board base) and state in one line how it satisfies the ask;
  * when the deliverable is a BOARD artifact (a posted job, plan, or design),
    check the board itself (journal/jobs/{plan,todo,doin,tada}/) — do not
    infer its existence from the preflight;
  * if you cannot name the artifact for every ask, treat exit 2 as PROCEED
    and do the work.
Never state in your report that a peer did work you did not verify.
