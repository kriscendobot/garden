scripts/jobs/issue-status-pass.sh
scripts/jobs/issue-status-pass.sh:211 repeatedly exhausts the tick before the source read (12:51:55Z, 13:17:05Z, 13:20:22Z). Read and trust-filter the source before expensive board snapshot work, reserving its configured timeout from the pass budget; then build the board only after a successful source read.
