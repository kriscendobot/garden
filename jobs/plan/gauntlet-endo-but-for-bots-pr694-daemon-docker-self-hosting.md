Run the gauntlet (clean → panel review → fix-loop → un-draft) on `endojs/endo-but-for-bots` DRAFT PR #694 `feat: Docker self-hosting image with authenticated remote gateway` (base `llm`, head `build/daemon-docker-selfhost-remote-gateway`), driving this freshly-built, mergeable-but-stranded PR toward mergeable to advance M3's headline exit criterion (self-host the daemon via Docker with a remote bearer-token gateway). Treat the known repo-wide lint projectService ceiling (tracked by #594) as pre-existing and out of scope; do not merge or touch superseded PR #608 (its disposition is a maintainer decision).
