handler-timeout: 7200
<!-- liaison 2026-08-06: this job was DOOMED by the reaper after a
     deterministic deadline overrun at the 2400s default. It carried no
     handler-timeout: header and its role does not qualify for the 7200s
     builder default (landed 2026-08-01), so it was SIGTERM-killed at the
     wall on every requeue. The budget is the fix; the work is wanted.
     If it overruns 7200s too, that is a REAL overrun -- diagnose it, do
     not raise the budget again. -->

Automatic gauntlet handoff for completed feature build minion-town-mcp-b2-first-guest-tools.

The build opened https://github.com/kriscendobot/minion.town/pull/17 and it remains an OPEN draft PR. Run the full gardening
state machine now: clean, panel, fixer loop as needed, CI, then un-draft only when
the panel terminates cleanly. This handoff was posted by the build completion edge,
not inferred by a watcher.
